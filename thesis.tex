\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
Older nasal cavities tend to exhibit a range of symptoms and pathologies more frequently than those of younger patients. These symptoms include variations in airconditioning functionality, as well as olfaction and mucosal clearance functionality. 
Several factors have been identified as potentially responsible for these symptoms. 
One issue that has been identified as a potential cause for a number of the identified symptoms is aberrations in airflow structures caused by age-related variations in nasal cavity anatomy. 
Various methods have been used to examine nasal patency between demographics, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) studies of airflow through nasal cavity models developed from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. 
To date CFD methods have not been used to examine airflow in older nasal cavities.
This study will apply previously developed techniques for interdemographic analysis to CFD simulation results from a series of older, Asian, adult male nasal cavity models.


The first section of this study is comprised of a comprehensive literature review to identify meaningful gaps in the current literature regarding computational analysis of older nasal cavities. 
The second section details the reconstruction methods used for creating the 5 nasal cavity geometries analysed.
The third section details the discretisation and setup of the CFD simulations carried out for the five models.
The fourth section analyses variations in geometry and airflow structures between the simulation results for the five models.

This study provides preliminary understanding connecting nasal anatomy, age and airflow dynamics. Although the study size was limited, it provides insight into potential relationships between inhaled airflow characteristics and geometry.
