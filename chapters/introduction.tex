\section{Background}

The ageing global population increases the need for investment in geriatrics. One area of particular significance within the field of geriatrics is that of geriatric rhinology. A range of dysfunctions and aberrations from the normal functioning of healthy adults have been observed in the nasal cavities of elderly populations\cite{Edelstein1996, Lindemann2008}. The occurrence of respiratory diseases in the elderly is markedly higher than that found in younger populations\cite{HO2001, Edelstein1996}. It has been suggested that these higher recorded rates is due in part to the impaired air conditioning functionality\cite{Lindemann2008}.


The nasal cavities of elderly citizens have also been shown by previous researchers to show increased volume\cite{Kalmovich2005}. Alterations in histiological function have also been shown\cite{HO2001}. The extent to which functional aberrations are caused by geometric [as opposed to histiological] variations remains unclear\cite{Varga-Huettner2013}. These changes in nasal physiology - and their impact on nasal functionality - need to be investigated further.


Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerically approximate flow field characteristics for a given domain. CFD  simulations give highly detailed results with information covering a range of areas for a given fluid system at a minimal cost. One area in which CFD simulations have been gaining credence is that of biomechanics; many biological fluid systems can be modelled effectively through CFD simulations, allowing for an unprecedented insight into their function.

The use of 3D medical imageing techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scans in collaboration with CFD has facilitated the use CFD modeling techniques to approximate numerically fluid mechanism parameters of anatomically accurate models. This allows for more detailed comparisons of the effects of topological variations on the relevant fluid mechanisms. I believe that this capacity fo detailed comparison makes CFD simulation an ideal tool for analysing the impact of physiological discrepencies in older specimens on nasal patency.


To date numerous inter-demographic studies have been carried out using CFD analysis of 3D models reconstructed from CT scan data. These studies have indicated that both ethnicity and gender are liable to impact on nasal physiology. Previous studies have focused on age, however to date these age related studies have all focused on children. I believe that the use of CFDs to examine functional variations in older models - accounting for other potential interdemographic variations (such as age or ethnicity) - is thus an important step that needs to be taken in order to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the role played by ageing in nasal patency.


\section{Research questions and objectives}

In light of the information posed above, the following questions seem pertinent:

\begin{itemize}

  \item How do changes in nasal cavity geometries of older Chinese Males influence their airflow mechanisms?

  \item How do the same changes impact on heat and vapour transfer within the cavity?

\end{itemize}

To answer the aforementioned questions, the following objectives have been outlined:

\begin{itemize}

  \item reconstruct a series of nasal cavity geometries from medical scans that represent a spread of geometric characteristics [such as volume and surface area] across the norm. The existing literature shows a clearly defined relationship between age and volume: these models will serve as a representation of the ageing population to be analysed compuationally.

  \item Model airflow across the series of reconstructed nasal cavities using computational fluid dynamic using a steady state assumption; defining inlet conditions to approximate a resting rate of respiration. 

  \item Compare the simulation results between geometries. A variety of post processing methods have been employed to compare various aspects of fluid mechanic functionaility of the nasal cavity models. The literature has shown clear discrepencies in the functionality of nasal cavities as a function of age; it is our intention through these measurements to examine in more detail the extent of these variations.

  \item  Compare results with existing results from various experimental methods from the previously extant literature.
\end{itemize}
 
\section{Research outline}

Medical image reconstruction technologies now allow researchers to reconstruct highly detailed, digital 3D representations of various anatomical structures from ct scans. When coupled with CFD simulations, this presents an unprecedented capacity for in depth analysis of physiological fluid flow mechanisms.

This study aims to use CFD analysis of CT scan data from the nasal cavities of a range of Asian males to investigate the impact of the age induced expansion of the nasal cavity on the air-conditioning functionality of the nasal cavity. Air flow mechanisms, heat transfer rates and humidification efficacy is analysed. The data is then discussed - in the context of the rhinological symptoms attributed by previous researches to elderly patients - in order to arrive at a more precise understanding of the role of nasal geometry in the presentation of said symptoms.

This study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first in depth, mechanistic, computational study undertaken into the role of nasal geometry in common rhinological symptoms observed in older patients.
