  Abstract                 = {Lung deposition fractions of nine experimental particle number distributions emitted by various light duty diesel vehicles with different after-treatment devices and fuels were calculated with a stochastic lung deposition model. The emitted volatile and non-volatile mass fractions were treated separately as the corresponding biological response in the human respiratory tract differs. The health related effects of the volatile mass fraction, referred to as the chemical effect, were associated with the deposited volatile mass. The deposited volatile mass depends on the total emitted volatile mass concentration, on its distribution (mass median diameter of nucleation mode and surface area median of the accumulation mode), and on the ratio of the volatile mass in the nucleation and accumulation modes. The effect of the non-volatile mass fraction, referred to as the physical effect, was associated with the surface area distribution of the accumulation mode. The deposited surface area of the non-volatile fraction depends on its emitted concentration and on the surface area median diameter of the size distribution. The calculations suggest the importance of selecting the appropriate distribution (surface, volatile or non-volatile mass) for an assessment of the health effects of diesel exhaust particles, and the importance of combined particulate mass and number distribution measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {The available inhalation toxicity information for acrylic acid (AA) suggests that lesions to the nasal cavity, specifically olfactory degeneration, are the most sensitive end point for developing a reference concentration (RfC). Advances in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, specifically the incorporation of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models, now make it possible to estimate the flux of inhaled chemicals within the nasal cavity of experimental species, specifically rats. The focus of this investigation was to apply an existing CFD-PBPK hybrid model in the estimation of an RfC to determine the impact of incorporation of this new modeling technique into the risk assessment process. Information provided in the literature on the toxicity and mode of action for AA was used to determine the risk assessment approach. A comparison of the approach used for the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) RfC with the approach using the CFD-PBPK hybrid model was also conducted. The application of the CFD-PBPK hybrid model in a risk assessment for AA resulted in an RfC of 79 ppb, assuming a minute ventilation of 13.8 l/min (20 m3/day) in humans. This value differs substantially from the RfC of 0.37 ppb estimated for AA by the U.S. EPA before the PBPK modeling advances became available. The difference in these two RfCs arises from many factors, with the main difference being the species selected (mouse vs. rat). The choice to conduct the evaluation using the rat was based on the availability of dosimetry data in this species. Once these data are available in the mouse, an assessment should be conducted using this information. Additional differences included the methods used for estimating the target tissue concentration, the uncertainty factors (UFs) applied, and the application of duration and uncertainty adjustments to the internal target tissue dose rather than the external exposure concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling has found frequent application in risk assessments where PBPK models serve as important adjuncts to studies on modes of action of xenobiotics. In this regard, studies on mode of action provide insight into both the sites/mechanisms of action and the form of the xenobiotic associated with toxic responses. Validated PBPK models permit calculation of tissue doses of xenobiotics and metabolites for a variety of conditions, i.e. at low-doses, in different animal species, and in different members of a human population. In this manner, these PBPK models support the low-dose and interspecies extrapolations that are important components of current risk assessment methodologies. PBPK models are sometimes referred to as physiological toxicokinetic (PT) models to emphasize their application with compounds causing toxic responses. Pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling in general has a rich history. Data-based PK compartmental models were developed in the 1930's when only primitive tools were available for solving sets of differential equations. These models were expanded in the 1960's and 1970's to accommodate new observations on dose-dependent elimination and flow-limited metabolism. The application of clearance concepts brought many new insights about the disposition of drugs in the body. In the 1970's PBPK/PT models were developed to evaluate metabolism of volatile compounds of occupational importance, and, for the first time, dose-dependent processes in toxicology were included in PBPK models in order to assess the conditions under which saturation of metabolic and elimination processes lead to non-linear dose response relationships. In the 1980's insights from chemical engineers and occupational toxicology were combined to develop PBPK/PT models to support risk assessment with methylene chloride and other solvents. The 1990's witnessed explosive growth in risk assessment applications of PBPK/PT models and in applying sensitivity and variability methods to evaluate model performance. Some of the compounds examined in detail include butadiene, styrene, glycol ethers, dioxins and organic esters/aids. This paper outlines the history of PBPK/PT modeling, emphasizes more recent applications of PBPK/TK models in health risk assessment, and discusses the risk assessment perspective provided by modern uses of these modeling approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {To examine whether the actual dimensions of human facial features are important to the development of a low-velocity inhalable particulate mass sampling criterion, this study evaluated the effect of facial feature dimensions (nose and lips) on estimates of aspiration efficiency of inhalable particles using computational fluid dynamics modeling over a range of indoor air and breathing velocities. Fluid flow and particle transport around four humanoid forms with different facial feature dimensions were simulated. All forms were facing the wind (0.2, 0.4 m sâˆ’1), and breathing was simulated with constant inhalation (1.81, 4.3, 12.11 m sâˆ’1). The fluid flow field was solved using standard k-epsilon turbulence equations, and laminar particle trajectories were used to determine critical areas defining inhaled particles. The critical areas were then used to compute the aspiration efficiency of the mouth-breathing humanoid. One-tailed t-tests indicated that models with larger nose and lip features resulted in significantly lower aspiration efficiencies than geometries with smaller features, but the shape of the orifice into the mouth (rounded rectangle versus elliptical) had no effect on aspiration efficiency. While statistically significant, the magnitudes of differences were small: on average, the large nose reduced aspiration efficiency by 6.5% and the large lips reduced aspiration efficiency by 3.2%. In comparison, a change in breathing velocity from at-rest to heavy increased aspiration efficiency by an average of 21% over all particle sizes, indicating a much greater impact of aspiration efficiency on breathing rate in the facing-the-wind orientation. Linear regression models confirmed that particle diameter and breathing velocity were significant predictors to the aspiration fraction, while the facial feature dimensions were not significant contributors to a unifying model. While these effects may be less pronounced as the orientation changes from facing-the-wind, their impact confirms the importance of breathing velocity and, to a lesser extent, facial feature dimensions on exposure estimates in low freestream velocities typical of occupational environments.},

The porous high-flow sampler oriented 30Â° downward showed reasonable agreement with published mannequin wind tunnel studies and humanoid CFD investigations for solid particle aspiration into the mouth, whereas the horizontal orientation resulted in oversampling. Liquid particles were under-aspirated in all cases, however, with 41â€“84% lower aspiration efficiencies relative to solid particles. A sampler with a single central 15-mm pore at 10 l minâˆ’1 was also investigated and was found to match the porous samplerâ€™s aspiration efficiency for solid particles; the single-pore sampler is expected to be more suitable for liquid particle use.},

  Abstract                 = {A population balance model for flocculation of PCC particles with polyelectrolytes of very high molecular weight, medium charge density and different degree of branching is presented. The model considers simultaneously aggregation, breakage and flocs restructuring to describe the PCC flocculation by bridging mechanism. The maximum collision efficiency factor, a parameter related with the fragmentation rate and a time constant for flocs restructuring have been taken as fitting parameters. These fitting parameters are optimized to get the best fit between experimental data obtained by LDS in a previous study and the modelled results. The optimized parameters were correlated with flocculant concentration, flocs structure and polymer branching. The correlations obtained show well the effects of flocculant concentration, flocs structure and polymer structure on the flocculation kinetics and flocs restructuring which are translated in the model parameters. Moreover, the flocs break up due to polymer degradation was introduced in the model by decreasing, with time, the maximum collision efficiency factor. It was shown that this effect can be neglected since the improvement in the results is too small relatively to the high increase of the computational time required to perform the simulation.},

The mucus simulant gels were prepared by mixing various proportions of 0.5-1.7% locust bean gum solution and 0.1Â M sodium tetraborate (XLB) solution. Surface tension of one set of samples was varied by adding different amounts of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) surfactant while the measurement of surface tension was performed using ADSA (axisymmetric drop shape analysis) method. The viscoelastic properties of the samples were measured using a Bohlin Gemini 200 HR (Malvern, UK) nano-rheometer with peltier plate assembly. An artificial cough machine was used to simulate human cough, generating aerosol droplets in a model trachea attached to the front of the cough machine. The size distribution and volume concentration of the droplets generated through simulated cough were measured using a laser diffraction particle sizer (SprayTec, Malvern, USA). The surface tension was found to have negligible effect on the characteristic of generated droplets within the range of this investigation. The experimental results showed a decrease in particle size as the samples changed from a viscous fluid type to a viscoelastic to an elastic solid type sample. The volume concentration also changed significantly as the viscoelasticity of the samples was varied.},

  Abstract                 = {Rationale and Objectives Lung cancer is caused primarily by repeated exposure to carcinogenic particulate matter and noxious gasses with high particulate deposition localized to airway bifurcations and the lung periphery. The quantitative measurement and analysis of these sites has the potential to stratify lung cancer risk. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the performance of a new method for estimating individual lung cancer risk based on the analysis of airway bifurcations on high-resolution (HR) computed tomographic (CT) scanning and spirometry.Materials and Methods One hundred eight subjects with spirometry and thin-slice CT data were selected from a CT screening study including 15 patients with early lung cancer and 93 age-matched and pack-year-matched controls. A subset of seven patients with cancer and 72 controls were scanned with 1-mm CT slice thickness, representing an HR case subset. A quantitative lung cancer risk index method was developed on the basis of airway bifurcation x-ray attenuation combined with the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel and conditional logistic regression tests were used to analyze performance.Results Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel crude analysis revealed a cancer detection sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 72% for all cases and 100% and 73% for the HR case subset, respectively. Conditional logistic regression showed that a 0.0328 increase in lung cancer risk index was associated with odds ratios of 1.84 (95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.85) for the full data set (P = .0067) and 2.89 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-8.19) for the HR subset (P = .0467).Conclusions A preliminary evaluation of a new lung cancer risk estimation method based on thin slice CT and spirometry showed a statistically significant association with lung cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) studies of the flow inside a modelled human extra-thoracic airway (ETA) were conducted to evaluate the performance of several turbulence models in predicting flow inside this complex geometry. Veracity of the computational models is assessed for physiologically accurate flow rates of 10, 15, and 30Â l/min by comparison of numerical results with hot-wire [Johnstone A, Uddin M, Pollard A, Heenan A, Finlay WH. The flow inside an idealised form of the human extra-thoracic airway. Exp Fluids 2004;37(5):673-89] and particle image velocimetry (PIV) [Heenan AF, Matida E, Pollard A, Finlay WH. Experimental measurements and computational modelling of the flow field in an idealised extra-thoracic airway. Exp Fluids 2003;35:70-84] mean velocity data for the central sagittal plane of the ETA. Furthermore, flow features predicted by numerical models are compared to those from experimental flow-visualisation studies [Johnstone et al., 2004]. The flow in the ETA is shown to be highly three-dimensional, having strong secondary flows.},

  Abstract                 = {Airborne transmission is known to be the route of infection for diseases such as tuberculosis and aspergillosis. It has also been implicated in nosocomial outbreaks of MRSA, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Despite this there is much scepticism about the role that airborne transmission plays in nosocomial outbreaks. This paper investigates the airborne spread of infection in hospital buildings, and evaluates the extent to which it is a problem. It is concluded that although contact-spread is the principle route of transmission for most infections, the contribution of airborne micro-organisms to the spread of infection is likely to be greater than is currently recognised. This is partly because many airborne micro-organisms remain viable while being non-culturable, with the result that they are not detected, and also because some infections arising from contact transmission involve the airborne transportation of micro-organisms onto inanimate surfaces.},

Using respiratory inductance plethysmography and a nasal mask fitted with flowmeter, we measured the nasal contribution to breathing at rest and during exercise (to 60% maximum workload) in healthy young adults (men/women = 11/11 and Caucasian/African-American = 11/11). We found that the nasal contribution to breathing is less during submaximal exercise in the Caucasians vs. African-Americans (e.g., at 60% maximum workload, mean nasal-to-total ventilation ratio = 0.40 {+/-} 0.21 and 0.65 {+/-} 0.24, respectively, P < 0.05). This difference is likely due to the African-Americans' ability to achieve higher maximal inspiratory flows through their nose than the Caucasians. Men also had a lesser nasal contribution to breathing during exercise compared with women. This is likely due to greater minute ventilations at any given percentage of maximum workload in men vs. women.},

  Abstract                 = {Aerosols deposition in turbulent bend flows is a major concern that is critical to many industrial, environmental and biomedical applications. In this work, a well-resolved LES was performed to compute the deposition efficiency of aerosols in turbulent circular cross-section bend flow of Dean number De=4,225. The numerical predictions were compared to the experimental work of Pui et al. [Pui, D.Y.H., Romay-Novas, F., Liu, B.Y.H., 1987. Experimental study of particle deposition in bend of circular cross-section. Aerosol Science Technol. 7, 301-315] and the fully-resolved LES of Breuer et al. [Breuer, M., Baytekin, H.T., Matida, E.A., 2006. Prediction of aerosol deposition in 90Â° bends using LES and an efficient Lagrangian tracking method. J. Aerosol Science 37, 1407-1428]. In the present LES, a slightly coarser but unstructured-grid numerical description was adopted, entailing that a portion of the small scales' contribution to particle dispersion to be discarded. Thus, a Langevin-type stochastic model was used to model the effect of the discarded sub-grid motion on aerosol deposition. This stochastic model was shown to perform well in previous studies [Berrouk, A.S., Laurence, D., Riley, J.J., Stock, D.E., 2007. Stochastic modelling of inertial particle dispersion by subgrid motion for LES of high Reynolds number pipe flow. J. Turbulence, 8, 50]. Good care was taken to ensure that the main dynamical features of the continuous phase were captured by the present LES. An estimation of the filtered-out kinetic energy was provided. Results of the present LES with SGS model for particles were found to compare well with the experimental work and the fully-resolved LES (near-wall DNS) of Breuer for all the range of the Stokes number considered, 0.001<St<1.5. Influence of the SGS model for particles was visible for the deposition efficiency of aerosols with Stokes number St<0.3.},

  Abstract                 = {Aiming at the better prediction of inertial particle dispersion in LES of turbulent shear flow, a stochastic diffusion process of the Langevin type is adopted to model the time increments of the fluid velocity seen by inertial particles. This modelling is particularly crucial for dispersion and deposition of inertial particles with small relaxation times compared to the smallest LES-resolved turbulence time scales. Simple closures for drift and diffusion terms are described. The effects of inertia and external forces on particle trajectories are modelled. To numerically validate the proposed model, LES calculations are performed to track solid particles (glass beads in air with different Stokes' numbers) in a high Reynolds number, equilibrium turbulent pipe flow (Re = 50 000 based on the maximum velocity and the pipe diameter). LES predictions are compared to RANS results and experimental observations. Simulation findings demonstrate the superiority of LES compared to RANS in predicting particle dispersion statistics. More importantly, the use of a stochastic approach to model the subgrid scale fluctuations has proven crucial for results concerning the small-Stokes-number particles. The influence of the model on particle deposition needs to be assessed and additional validation for non-equilibrium turbulent flows is required.},

  Abstract                 = {Fiber length has been implicated as a determinant of fiber toxicity. Fibers of narrowly defined length can be generated by dielectrophoretic classifiers. Since the quantities of fibers produced are very small, we developed a rat alveolar macrophage microculture system to study the toxicity of these samples. The objective of this study was to examine the role of fiber length on the cytotoxicity of Manville code 100 (JM-100) fibers. Rat alveolar macrophages were cultured with 0-500 microg/ml of 5 lengths of JM-100 fibers on 96-well plates. After 18 h, well supernatants were removed and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured to assess cell damage. Chemiluminescence (CL), an assessment of macrophage function, was measured by adding lucigenin with or without zymosan, a particulate stimulus, to appropriate wells. For each fiber length the effects were concentration dependent: CL declined and LDH rose with increasing fiber concentration. Comparing the effects of different lengths showed the greatest toxicity from a relatively long fiber sample (mean length = 17 microm). Microscopic examination of the interaction of fibers with macrophages revealed multiple macrophages attached along the length of the long fibers. This suggests that frustrated, or incomplete, phagocytosis may be a factor in the increased toxicity of longer fibers. Overall the results demonstrate that length is an important determinant of toxicity for JM-100 fibers.},

  Abstract                 = {The respiratory tract is frequently identified as a site of toxicity for inhaled xenobiotic chemicals. Usually, these observations come from controlled animal studies. For these studies to be of quantitative value to human health risk assessment, species-specific factors governing dosimetry of inhaled substances must be taken into account. Toxicokinetics of vapours in the respiratory tract are defined by absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, as they are in other tissues; however, these concepts take on new dimensions when considering respiratory tract toxicants, especially those that elicit portal of entry effects by directly interacting with the tissue lining the respiratory tract. Species-specific factors related to anatomy, physiology and biochemistry govern inter-species extrapolation of toxicokinetics. This article discusses critical factors of respiratory tract kinetics that should be considered when developing physiological-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models for inhaled vapours. Important considerations such as impact of regional airflow-delivery, water solubility, reactivity, and rates of local biotransformation on respiratory tract tissue dosimetry are highlighted. These factors can be accounted for only to a limited extent when using default approaches to extrapolate dosimetry of inhaled substances across species. On the other hand, PBTK modeling has the flexibility to accommodate many of the critical determinants of respiratory tract toxicity. PBTK models can also help identify the most critical toxicokinetic data necessary to replace defaults. PBTK approaches have led to more informed estimates of human target tissue dose, and therefore human health risk, especially where these risk assessments have been based on extrapolation of animal dosimetry studies. Experience derived from the development of more intensive case studies have, in turn, enabled simplified approaches to the use of PBTK modeling for respiratory tract toxicants. Whether simplified or highly complex, PBTK modeling approaches are proven to be of great utility to risk assesors interested in applying quantitative information to informed risk assessment evaluations.},

  Abstract                 = {The remodelling process of COPD may affect both airway calibre and the homothety factor, which is a constant parameter describing the reduction of airway lumen (hd: diameter of child/parent bronchus) that might be critical because its reduction would induce a frank increase in airway resistance. Airway dimensions were obtained from CT scan images of smokers with (nÂ =Â 22) and without COPD (nÂ =Â 9), and airway resistance from plethysmography. Inspiratory airway resistance correlated to lumen area of the sixth bronchial generation of right lung, while peak expiratory flow correlated to the area of the third right generation (pÂ =Â 0.0009, RÂ =Â 0.57). A significant relationship was observed between hd and resistance (pÂ =Â 0.036; R2Â =Â 0.14). A modelling approach of central airways (5 generations) further described the latter relationship. In conclusion, a constant homothety factor can be described by CT scan analysis, which partially explains inspiratory resistance, as predicted by theoretical arguments. Airway resistance is related to lumen areas of less proximal airways than commonly admitted.},

Research pre-1978 is also briefly reviewed. Following this review, our current knowledge of iced airfoil aerodynamics is presented from a flowfield-physics perspective. This article identifies four classes of ice accretions: roughness, horn ice, streamwise ice, and spanwise-ridge ice. For each class, the key flowfield features such as flowfield separation and reattachment are discussed and how these contribute to the known aerodynamic effects of these ice shapes. Finally Reynolds number and Mach number effects on iced-airfoil aerodynamics are summarized.},

  Abstract                 = {Aiming at the better prediction of pharmaceutical aerosol deposition in extrathoracic airways, a simpler test case, namely a 90o bend flow (tubular cross-section) laden with monodisperse particles, is adopted here and studied numerically. The continuous phase is calculated using a large-eddy simulation technique along with a finite-volume method for block-structured curvilinear grids. The particulate phase is simulated using a Lagrangian approach where hundred thousands of individual monodisperse particles with varying particle diameters are released and tracked throughout the computational domain. To allow such a large number of particles, a highly efficient tracking algorithm is applied, where particle paths are predicted in an orthogonal computational domain, avoiding time-consuming search algorithm, normally required when particles are tracked in the actual physical domain of a curvilinear body-fitted block-structured grid. Both simulation algorithms, for the continuous and particulate phases, are completely parallelized using domain decomposition. Additionally, the in-house code applied supports vector processing allowing efficient usage of nearly all kinds of high-performance architectures. Two different Reynolds numbers ReD are considered where ReD is based on the bend diameter and mean flow velocity. The first case is within the laminar regime at ReD=1000 and serves for the purpose of verification and validation. The second, more challenging case comprises the turbulent regime at ReD=10,000, which is the intrinsic objective of the present study. Depending on the Stokes number of the particles, 0.001[less-than-or-equals, slant]St[less-than-or-equals, slant]1.5, and the releasing locations at the entrance of the bend, the particles will either deposit on the wall or penetrate and exit the computational domain. Simulation results of aerosol deposition efficiency, over the entire range of particle diameters considered here, show an excellent agreement when compared to experimental values obtained by Pui, Romay-Novas, and Liu [(1987).

  Abstract                 = {The present work consists of a validation attempt of an effervescent spray model with secondary atomization. The objective is the simulation of a 1Â MW industrial-type liquid fuel burner equipped with effervescent spray nozzle. The adopted approach is based on a double experimental validation. Firstly, the evolution of radial drop size distributions of an isothermal spray is investigated. Secondly, the spray model is tested in a swirling combustion simulation by means of measured wall heat flux profile along the flame. In the first part of the paper, both experiments are described along with the measuring techniques. Drop sizes and velocities measured using a Dantec phase/Doppler particle analyzer are analyzed in detail for six radial positions. Local heat fluxes are measured by a reliable technique along the furnace walls in a large-scale water-cooled laboratory furnace. In the second part Euler - Lagrange approach is applied for two-phase flow spray simulations. The adopted spray model is based on the latest industrially relevant (i.e. computationally manageable) primary and secondary breakup sub-models complemented with droplet collision model and a dynamic droplet drag model. Results show discrepancies in the prediction of radial evolution of Sauter mean diameter and exaggerated bimodality in drop size distributions. A partial qualitative agreement is found in radial evolution of drop size distributions. Difficulties in predicting the formation of small drops are highlighted. Comparison of the predicted wall heat fluxes and measured heat loads in swirling flame combustion simulation shows that the absence of the smallest droplets causes a significant elongation of the flame.},

Trajectories of individual fragments can be studied from the moment of breakage where the progeny might originate from incremental, simultaneous and/or repetitive fragmentation events. A particle breaks depending on the applied dynamic impact forces from collisions, the damage history, the particle size and material properties. This 3D model requires setting parameters solely dependent on the particle material and is consequently independent of any empirical value. Mass, momentum and energy is conserved during breakage. A theoretically consistent description from the onset of fragmentation to the cloud formation after breakage is provided and model outcomes have been compared to experimental results and other model predictions where very little deviation has been encountered. All material parameters have been varied independently to study the sensitivity of the model under dynamic fragmentation of numerous particles in a semi-autogenous mill.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies on health effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) have traditionally focused on particles <10 {micro}m in diameter (PM10) or particles <2.5 {micro}m in diameter (PM2.5). The coarse fraction of PM10, particles >2.5 {micro}m, has only been studied recently. These particles have different sources and composition compared with PM2.5. This paper is based on a systematic review of studies that have analysed fine and coarse PM jointly and examines the epidemiological evidence for effects of coarse particles on health. Time series studies relating ambient PM to mortality have in some places provided evidence of an independent effect of coarse PM on daily mortality, but in most urban areas, the evidence is stronger for fine particles. The few long-term studies of effects of coarse PM on survival do not provide any evidence of association. In studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and respiratory admissions, coarse PM has a stronger or as strong short-term effect as fine PM, suggesting that coarse PM may lead to adverse responses in the lungs triggering processes leading to hospital admissions. There is also support for an association between coarse PM and cardiovascular admissions. It is concluded that special consideration should be given to studying and regulating coarse particles separately from fine particles.},

Upside down cultivation did not impair the barrier function, morphology and viability of Calu-3 cells. Size selective deposition with subsequent absorption was studied for three different commercially available dry powder formulations of salbutamol sulphate and budesonide. After deposition without size separation the absorption rates from the aerosol formulations differed but correlated with the size of the carrier lactose particles. However, after deposition in the MSLI, simulating relevant impaction and causing the separation of small drug crystals from the carrier lactose, the absorption rates of the three formulations were identical, confirming the bioequivalence of the three formulations.},

  Abstract                 = {The essential function of the lung, gas exchange, is dependent on adequate matching of ventilation and perfusion, where air and blood are delivered through complex branching systems exposed to regionally varying transpulmonary and transmural pressures. Structure and function in the lung are intimately related, yet computational models in pulmonary physiology usually simplify or neglect structure. The geometries of the airway and vascular systems and their interaction with parenchymal tissue have an important bearing on regional distributions of air and blood, and therefore on whole lung gas exchange, but this has not yet been addressed by modelling studies. Models for gas exchange have typically incorporated considerable detail at the level of chemical reactions, with little thought for the influence of structure. To date, relatively little attention has been paid to modelling at the cellular or subcellular level in the lung, or to linking information from the protein structure/interaction and cellular levels to the operation of the whole lung. We review previous work in developing anatomically based models of the lung, airways, parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature, and some functional studies in which these models have been used. Models for gas exchange at several spatial scales are briefly reviewed, and the challenges and benefits from modelling cellular function in the lung are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This review is presented as a common foundation for scientists interested in nanoparticles, their origin,activity, and biological toxicity. It is written with the goal of rationalizing and informing public health concerns related to this sometimes-strange new science of "nano," while raising awareness of nanomaterials' toxicity among scientists and manufacturers handling them.We show that humans have always been exposed to tiny particles via dust storms, volcanic ash, and other natural processes, and that our bodily systems are well adapted to protect us from these potentially harmful intruders. There ticuloendothelial system, in particular, actively neutralizes and eliminates foreign matter in the body,including viruses and nonbiological particles. Particles originating from human activities have existed for millennia, e.g., smoke from combustion and lint from garments, but the recent development of industry and combustion-based engine transportation has profoundly increased an thropogenic particulate pollution. Significantly, technological advancement has also changed the character of particulate pollution, increasing the proportion of nanometer-sized particles--"nanoparticles"--and expanding the variety of chemical compositions. Recent epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between particulate air pollution levels, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, and mortality. Adverse effects of nanoparticles on human health depend on individual factors such as genetics and existing disease, as well as exposure, and nanoparticle chemistry, size, shape,agglomeration state, and electromagnetic properties. Animal and human studies show that inhaled nanoparticles are less efficiently removed than larger particles by the macrophage clearance mechanisms in the lungs, causing lung damage, and that nanoparticles can translocate through the circulatory, lymphatic, and nervous systems to many tissues and organs, including the brain. The key to understanding the toxicity of nanoparticles is that their minute size, smaller than cells and cellular organelles, allows them to penetrate these basic biological structures, disrupting their normal function.Examples of toxic effects include tissue inflammation, and altered cellular redox balance toward oxidation, causing abnormal function or cell death. The manipulation of matter at the scale of atoms,"nanotechnology," is creating many new materials with characteristics not always easily predicted from current knowledge. Within the nearly limitless diversity of these materials, some happen to be toxic to biological systems, others are relatively benign, while others confer health benefits. Some of these materials have desirable characteristics for industrial applications, as nanostructured materials often exhibit beneficial properties, from UV absorbance in sunscreen to oil-less lubrication of motors.A rational science-based approach is needed to minimize harm caused by these materials, while supporting continued study and appropriate industrial development. As current knowledge of the toxicology of "bulk" materials may not suffice in reliably predicting toxic forms of nanoparticles,ongoing and expanded study of "nanotoxicity" will be necessary. For nanotechnologies with clearly associated health risks, intelligent design of materials and devices is needed to derive the benefits of these new technologies while limiting adverse health impacts. Human exposure to toxic nanoparticles can be reduced through identifying creation-exposure pathways of toxins, a study that may someday soon unravel the mysteries of diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Reduction in fossil fuel combustion would have a large impact on global human exposure to nanoparticles, as would limiting deforestation and desertification.While nanotoxicity is a relatively new concept to science, this review reveals the result of life's long history of evolution in the presence of nanoparticles, and how the human body, in particular, has adapted to defend itself against nanoparticulate intruders.},

  Abstract                 = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling approach is used to study the unsteady respiratory airflow dynamics within a human lung. The three-dimensional asymmetric bifurcation model of the central airway based on the morphological data given by Horsfield et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 67 (1971) 207) was used in the present study to simulate the oscillatory respiratory. The single bifurcation was found to be sufficient to give a number of results which both qualitatively and quantitatively agreed well with other published experimental and CFD results. Numerical simulation were made for two breathing conditions: (a) resting or normal breathing condition and (b) maximal exercise condition. The respiratory flow results for the both conditions are found strongly dependent on the convective effect and the viscous effect with some contribution of the unsteadiness effect. The secondary motions were stronger for the normal breathing condition as compared with the maximal exercise condition. The difference between the two cases is the flow separation regions found close to the carinal ridge for maximal exercise condition. For normal breathing condition no separation regions was observed in this region.},

While modern imaging and airway casting approaches have dramatically improved the potential detail of such models, challenges have arisen in image processing as the demand for greater detail pushes the image processing approaches to their limits. Airway segmentations with proper topology have neither loops nor invalid voxel-to-voxel connections. Here we describe a new technique for segmenting airways with proper topology and apply the approach to an image volume generated by magnetic resonance imaging of a silicone cast created from an excised monkey lung.},

  Abstract                 = {A new drift-flux model for particle distribution and deposition in indoor environments is developed. Gravitational settling and deposition are examined thoroughly and the model is applied to simulate particle distribution and deposition in a ventilated model room. The turbulent airflow field is modeled with the renormalization group (RNG) k-[epsilon] turbulence model. For the particulate phase, the concentration field is divided into two regions, the core region and the concentration boundary layer. The concentration distribution in the core region is obtained by solving a three-dimensional particle transport equation. Deposition flux towards the wall is determined with a semi-empirical particle deposition model. With the feasibility of the proposed Eulerian model, the influences of the other deposition mechanisms can be captured easily into the model. The model is validated experimentally and a good agreement between numerical and experimental results is found. Inferring from the result, it shows that the well-mixed assumption cannot hold for coarse particles. The model presented in the current work provides an efficient and reliable tool for investigation of spatial and temporal particle concentration in enclosures and the result will be very useful for improving our current understanding of human exposure assessment.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Intranasal medications are commonly used in treating nasal diseases. However, technical details of the correct usage of these medications for nasal cavity with obstruction are unclear. Methods: A three-dimensional model of nasal cavity was constructed from MRI scans of a healthy human subject. Nasal cavities corresponding to healthy, moderate, and severe nasal obstruction (NO) were simulated by enlarging the inferior turbinate geometrically, which was documented by approximately one-third reduction of the minimum cross-sectional area for the moderate and two-thirds for the severe obstruction. The discrete phase model based on steady-state computational fluid dynamics was used to study the gas-particle flow. The results were presented with drug particle (from 7 × 10sup]-5 to 10sup]-7 m) deposition distribution along the lateral walls inside these three nasal cavities, and comparisons of the particle ratio escaping from the cavity were also presented and discussed. Results: Nasal patency is an essential condition that had the most impact on particle deposition of the factors studied; the particle percentage escaping the nasal cavity decreased to less than a half and one-tenth for the moderately and severely blocked noses. Decreasing of flow rate and particle diameter increased the escaping ratio; however, zero escaping percentage was detected with the absence of air flow and the effect was less noticeable when the particle diameter was very small (<10sup]-6 m). The existence of inspiratory flow and head tilt angle helped to improve the particle escaping ratio for the healthy nose; however, such changes were not significant for the moderately and severely blocked noses. Conclusion: When using an intranasal medication, it is advisable to have a moderate inspiratory air-flow rate and small size particles to improve particle escaping ratio. Various head positions suggested by clinicians do not seem to improve the drug escaping ratio significantly for the nasal cavities with inferior turbinate hypertrophy.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Intranasal medications are commonly used in treating nasal diseases. However, technical details of the correct usage of these medications for nasal cavity with obstruction are unclear. Methods: A three-dimensional model of nasal cavity was constructed from MRI scans of a healthy human subject. Nasal cavities corresponding to healthy, moderate, and severe nasal obstruction (NO) were simulated by enlarging the inferior turbinate geometrically, which was documented by approximately one-third reduction of the minimum cross-sectional area for the moderate and two-thirds for the severe obstruction. The discrete phase model based on steady-state computational fluid dynamics was used to study the gas-particle flow. The results were presented with drug particle (from 7 × 10sup]-5 to 10sup]-7 m) deposition distribution along the lateral walls inside these three nasal cavities, and comparisons of the particle ratio escaping from the cavity were also presented and discussed. Results: Nasal patency is an essential condition that had the most impact on particle deposition of the factors studied; the particle percentage escaping the nasal cavity decreased to less than a half and one-tenth for the moderately and severely blocked noses. Decreasing of flow rate and particle diameter increased the escaping ratio; however, zero escaping percentage was detected with the absence of air flow and the effect was less noticeable when the particle diameter was very small (<10sup]-6 m). The existence of inspiratory flow and head tilt angle helped to improve the particle escaping ratio for the healthy nose; however, such changes were not significant for the moderately and severely blocked noses. Conclusion: When using an intranasal medication, it is advisable to have a moderate inspiratory air-flow rate and small size particles to improve particle escaping ratio. Various head positions suggested by clinicians do not seem to improve the drug escaping ratio significantly for the nasal cavities with inferior turbinate hypertrophy.},

  Abstract                 = {This report describes an experimental study of aerosol deposition in a human nasal cast. A clear polyester resin cast of the upper airways of a normal human adult was used. This life-sized model included nasal hairs, the nasal airways, oral cavity, nasopharynx, larynx and entrance to the trachea. For nasal air flow rates, the measured pressure drop in the cast was similar to the in vivo measurements reported in the literature. Thus, the cast appeared to be a good representation of the nasal airways of living humans. The total deposition was measured in the cast for monodisperse NaCl aerosols between 0.2 and 0.0046 Î¼m at flow rates between 4 and 50 l minâˆ’1 of inspiratory flow. The deposition efficiency increased with decreasing particle size and flow rate, indicating that diffusion was the dominant mechanism for deposition. At 20 1 minâˆ’1 flow (comparable to that for normal breating at rest), inspiratory deposition efficiencies were 16 and 40% for 0.01 and 0.005 Î¼m particles, respectively. A theoretical equation relating the deposition efficiency to the flow rate and diffusion coefficient was derived based on a turbulent diffusion process. The agreement achieved between the theoretical and measured deposition indicated that the turbulent diffusion was the dominant mechanism of deposition in the nasal cast. This information will be incorporated into future models of respiratory tract dosimetry.},

  Abstract                 = {Substantial deposition of either very large or very small particles in the nasal airways prevents many inhaled particles from reaching the tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions. Deposition efficiency in the head airways is a function of particle size, breathing pattern and airway geometry. The results of experiments with human volunteers and physical replica models provide the data necessary for calculating deposition fractions in the head airways. All of the earlier studies focused on particles larger than 0.5 Âµm, inertial deposition is the dominant mechanism; for particles smaller than 0.5 Âµm, diffusional deposition is dominant. By assuming turbulent flow and complete mixing of aerosol in the head airways, we derived the following equation: di=1exp (-a dar2Q-b D1/2Q-1/8). Constants a and b are estimated from experimental data and are a function of breathing mode (inspiration or expiration). The combination of turbulent inertial and diffusional deposition mechanisms results in increased deposition for particles either greater than 1 Âµm or smaller than 0.1 Âµm, with minimal deposition for particles in the size range of 0.1 to 1 Âµm. These expressions provide estimates for nasal airway deposition of particles ranging from 1 nm to over 20 Âµm in diameter and are useful for dosimetry calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {The layout of the production line in any clean rooms will change according to the production process and this posed a problem for post clean room maintenance. Air velocity is one of the many problematic issues commonly found in clean room environment. It is important to address this on-going problem whenever there is an upgrading of the production process in which more advanced equipment were being introduced to the clean room to automate the process. This paper examines the characteristics of airflow distribution within the clean room due to changes in the production process. This study was conducted for a class 100 clean room at a disk-drive manufacturing firm. The airflow distribution in the clean room was simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. This model provides a valuable insight into the processes that are difficult and time-consuming to study experimentally. The results showed that furniture such as a workbench and a laminar flow hood have great impact on the airflow pattern in the clean room. The predicted airflow results offered substantial benefits in the design and development of a better furniture layout plan that eradicates any of the possible turbulence problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a ubiquitous master transcription factor that regulates antioxidant response elements (AREs)-mediated expression of antioxidant enzyme and cytoprotective proteins. In the unstressed condition, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) suppresses cellular Nrf2 in cytoplasm and drives its proteasomal degradation. Nrf2 can be activated by diverse stimuli including oxidants, pro-oxidants, antioxidants, and chemopreventive agents. Nrf2 induces cellular rescue pathways against oxidative injury, abnormal inflammatory and immune responses, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. Application of Nrf2 germ-line mutant mice has identified an extensive range of protective roles for Nrf2 in experimental models of human disorders in the liver, gastrointestinal tract, airway, kidney, brain, circulation, and immune or nerve system. In the lung, lack of Nrf2 exacerbated toxicity caused by multiple oxidative insults including supplemental respiratory therapy (e.g., hyperoxia, mechanical ventilation), cigarette smoke, allergen, virus, bacterial endotoxin and other inflammatory agents (e.g., carrageenin), environmental pollution (e.g., particles), and a fibrotic agent bleomycin. Microarray analyses and bioinformatic studies elucidated functional AREs and Nrf2-directed genes that are critical components of signaling mechanisms in pulmonary protection by Nrf2. Association of loss of function with promoter polymorphisms in NRF2 or somatic and epigenetic mutations in KEAP1 and NRF2 has been found in cohorts of patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome or lung cancer, which further supports the role for NRF2 in these lung diseases. In the current review, we address the role of Nrf2 in airways based on emerging evidence from experimental oxidative disease models and human studies.},

  Abstract                 = {This study deals with the numerical prediction and experimental description of the flow-induced deformation in a rapidly convergent-divergent geometry which stands for a simplified tongue, in interaction with an expiratory airflow. An original in vitro experimental model is proposed, which allows measurement of the deformation of the artificial tongue, in condition of major initial airway obstruction. The experimental model accounts for asymmetries in geometry and tissue properties which are two major physiological upper airway characteristics. The numerical method for prediction of the fluid-structure interaction is described. The theory of linear elasticity in small deformations has been chosen to compute the mechanical behaviour of the tongue. The main features of the flow are taken into account using a boundary layer theory. The overall numerical method entails finite element solving of the solid problem and finite differences solving of the fluid problem. First, the numerical method predicts the deformation of the tongue with an overall error of the order of 20%, which can be seen as a preliminary successful validation of the theory and simulations. Moreover, expiratory flow limitation is predicted in this configuration. As a result, both the physical and numerical models could be useful to understand this phenomenon reported in heavy snorers and apneic patients during sleep.},

Systematic comparisons between simulations and measurements were performed on an in vitro replica, which reflects asymmetries of the geometry and of the tissue properties at the base of the tongue and in pathological conditions (strong initial obstruction). First, partial obstruction is observed and predicted. Moreover, the prediction accuracy of the numerical model is of 4.2% concerning the deformation (mean quadratic error on the constriction area).

Digital PIV is an experimental method used to evaluate airflow in an accurately reproduced transparent model of the nasal cavity. In this review, use of the DPIV procedure in the study of nasal airflow, airflow patterns in quiet respiration, and changes to airflow after modification of the nasal turbinates are reviewed, along with aspects of the DPIV technique and the future role of DPIV in this field of research.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the properties of airflow in the nasal cavity is essential to understanding physiologic and pathologic aspects of nasal breathing. Many attempts have been made to evaluate nasal airflow patterns using the best possible analytical methods available at the time. Recently, digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) and computational fluid dynamic methods have been applied to this area. Digital PIV is an experimental method used to evaluate airflow in an accurately reproduced transparent model of the nasal cavity. In this review, use of the DPIV procedure in the study of nasal airflow, airflow patterns in quiet respiration, and changes to airflow after modification of the nasal turbinates are reviewed, along with aspects of the DPIV technique and the future role of DPIV in this field of research.},

  Abstract                 = {Porous foam provides an inexpensive, light-weight and effective medium to capture physiologically-relevant aerosol fractions. It can be manufactured to have a wide range of properties relevant to aerosol deposition. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to measure particle penetration though porous foam media of varying pore size and foam length. Both solid and liquid aerosols (0.01-10Â [mu]m diameter) were tested using a Sequenzial Mobility Particle Sizer or Aerodynamic Particle Sizer to count and size particles penetrating the foam. With this data, an existing semi-empirical model was improved upon to predict particle penetration through a foam of a given fiber diameter, and thickness. The model is based on three dimensionless parameters (St, Ng, Pe) that account for inertial, gravitational, and diffusive modes of deposition, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {50 subjects were admitted into a randomized double-blind placebo controlled cross-over trial with 4% lignocaine as the active drug and normal saline as the placebo. Each subject had 2 ml of solution sprayed into each nasal cavity and all subjects had both sprays but on different occasions. The order in which the sprays were administered was randomized. The subjective sensation of nasal airflow was measured using a visual anologue scale before and after the spray. These measurements were made under conditions of the same airflow rate, which was monitored throughout the experiment using a reprogrammed NR6 rhinomanometer. Objective nasal patency was measured as peak nasal inspiratory flow rate. It was found that the nasal sensation of airflow decreased slightly after both lignocaine (difference between medians 5.0; 95% confidence interval 20142.91 to 6.11) and normal saline (difference between medians 6.0; 95% confidence interval 2014 1.02 to 7.21). Nonparametric analysis of variance showed this difference to be non-significant (P = 0.73). In addition there was no significant change in objective nasal patency. The results suggest that nerve endings in the nasal mucosa play no part in sensing nasal airflow during respiration.},

  Abstract                 = {This study investigates (1) the effect of modifying the design of a dry powder inhaler on the device performance, and (2) which design features significantly contribute to overall inhaler performance. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to determine how the flowfield generated in an Aerolizer at 60 l min(-1) varied when the inhaler grid and mouthpiece were modified. The computational models were validated by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). Dispersion performance of the modified inhalers was measured with a mannitol powder using a multistage liquid impinger at 60 l min(-1). The inhaler grid was found to significantly affect the performance of the Aerolizer. As the grid voidage was increased, the amount of powder retained in the device doubled (due to increased tangential flow of particles in the inhaler mouthpiece) and the FPF(Loaded) was reduced from 57 to 44% (due to increased mouthpiece retention). The length of the mouthpiece played a lesser role on the inhaler performance, having no significant effect on the flowfield generated in the devices. In summary, the performance of a dry powder inhaler can be affected by simple design changes. CFD, coupled with experimental results, provides a rational basis for understanding the performance difference.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational approaches are being developed to study a range of problems in aeroacoustics. These aeroacoustic problems may be classified based on the physical processes responsible for the sound radiation, and range from linear problems of radiation, refraction, and scattering in known base flows or by solid bodies, to sound generation by turbulence. In this article, we focus mainly on the challenges and successes associated with numerically simulating sound generation by turbulent flows. We discuss a hierarchy of computational approaches that range from semi-empirical schemes that estimate the noise sources using mean-flow and turbulence statistics, to high-fidelity unsteady flow simulations that resolve the sound generation process by direct application of the fundamental conservation principles. We stress that high-fidelity methods such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) have their merits in helping to unravel the flow physics and the mechanisms of sound generation. They also provide rich databases for modeling activities that will ultimately be needed to improve existing predictive capabilities. Spatial and temporal discretization schemes that are well-suited for aeroacoustic calculations are analyzed, including the effects of artificial dispersion and dissipation on uniform and nonuniform grids. We stress the importance of the resolving power of the discretization as well as computational efficiency of the overall scheme. Boundary conditions to treat the flow of disturbances in and out of the computational domain, as well as methods to mimic anechoic domain extension are discussed. Test cases on some benchmark problems are included to provide a realistic assessment of several boundary condition treatments. Finally, highlights of recent progress are given using selected model problems. These include subsonic cavity noise and jet noise. In the end, the current challenges in aeroacoustic modeling and in simulation algorithms are revisited with a look toward the future developments.},

The injection of deterministic upstream fluctuations in the large-eddy simulation (LES) domain is found to be of crucial importance, in contrast with the baseflow case. Reduction of the vortex impingement onto the aft edge of the cavity is confirmed, together with reduction of mass flow rate breathing through the grazing plane. Visual evidence of merging between the Kelvin-Helmholtz-type vortices shed downstream of the fore edge of the cavity and the von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortices shed behind the cylinder is provided. Shocklets downstream of the cylinder are also observed.},

  Abstract                 = {Propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PM), along with its acetate, is the most widely used of the propylene glycol ether family of solvents. The most common toxic effects of PM observed in animal studies include sedation, very slight alpha2u-globulin mediated nephropathy (male rats only) and hepatomegally at high exposures (typicallyÂ >Â 1000Â ppm). Sedation in animal studies usually resolves within a few exposures to 3000Â ppm (the highest concentration used in subchronic and chronic inhalation studies) due to the induction of metabolizing enzymes. Data from a variety of pharmacokinetic and mechanistic studies have been incorporated into a PBPK model for PM and its acetate in rats and mice. Published controlled exposure and workplace biomonitoring studies have also been included for comparisons of the internal dosimetry of PM and its acetate between laboratory animals and humans. PM acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed to PM, which is further metabolized to either glucuronide or sulfate conjugates (minor pathways) or propylene glycol (major pathway). In vitro half-lives for PM acetate range from 14 to 36Â min depending upon the tissue and species. In vivo half-lives are considerably faster, reflecting the total contributions of esterases in the blood and tissues of the body, and are on the order of just a few minutes. Thus, very little PM acetate is found in vivo and, other than potential portal of entry irritation, the toxicity of PM acetate is related to PM. Regardless of the source for PM (either PM or its acetate), rats were predicted to have a higher Cmax and AUC for PM in blood than humans, especially at concentrations greater than the current ACGIH TLV of 100Â ppm. This would indicate that the major systemic effects of PM would be expected to be less severe in humans than rats at comparable inhalation exposures.},

  Abstract                 = {The nanoparticle production with well defined properties is of great scientific and technological interest due to the increasing number of applications of such material. Crystallization may be a suitable unit operation for producing nanoparticles, since it may be conceptually designed to be an intensified process. The mean particle size, the particle morphology, the modality and the broadness of the particle size distribution (PSD) are important indications of the quality of a particulate product. By synthesizing nanocrystals with narrow PSD, it is possible to produce advanced nanomaterials with tailored properties. There are possible interaction effects that may be unique to nanoparticles due to the size dependence of properties. These effects must be accounted for in predictive models, which are useful either for exploratory investigations or as a tool for computer operated procedures. For online process control, time calculations should not be greater than a few seconds, and, therefore, a population balance model should be more appropriate than stochastic methods. However, at present there is no consensus and complete knowledge by the scientific community of all needed parameters and which are the computer tools for a workable framework for dealing with nanoparticles reliable process design and on-line applications. This paper proposes to discuss important aspects of nanoparticle crystallization processes in order to bring light to nanoparticle modelling. In order to do so, the key factors influencing nanoparticulate processes and how they can be accounted for, going from a molecular to a process engineering approach, are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Over recent years the research focus within the field of respiratory drug delivery has broadened to include a wide range of potential applications for inhalation by delivering drugs not just onto the lung mucosa but across it. The range of drugs being assessed is broad and includes both current and novel therapies and there are a growing number of additives that appear capable of enhancing systemic absorption. Comprehensive characterisation of drug delivery to the lungs is a complex task involving the determination of delivered, deposited and (for systemically-targeted drugs) absorbed dose. As it is difficult to simulate in vitro, in vivo whole animal models are still key to inhaled drug development. Because of the anatomical complexities and interspecies differences in the lungs, the appropriate choice of species and drug delivery method is vital during study design. New delivery devices designed specifically for animal studies as well as more sophisticated methods to determine drug deposition and absorption after inhalation are improving the information derived from these studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Turbulent flow in a channel with transverse rib roughness on one wall is investigated by large-eddy simulation (LES). The spacing of the roughness elements is varied to reproduce the so-called d- and k-type roughness, and an intermediate roughness between the two. The time-mean and instantaneous flows are analyzed. The LES results agree with the rather limited laboratory observations in flows with rib roughness, and provide new insights into the effects of roughness on the mean flow as well as the turbulence structure. In d-type roughness, the outer flow almost rides over the roughness layer, in the mean, with the separation eddies confined to the gaps between the ribs. For intermediate roughness, between the d-type and k-type, the mean separation region is about the same size as the cavity between the ribs, but the outer flow is affected by large turbulent eddies emanating from the roughness layer. For k-type roughness, separation and reattachment occur between two adjoining ribs, much larger and more frequent eddies are thrown into the outer flow, resulting in strong interaction between the roughness layer and the outer flow. Time and space averaged velocity profiles show the well-known downward shift of the semi-logarithmic portion of the law of the wall. This result is quite surprising in view of the grossly varying spatial structure of the instantaneous flow.},

Deposition increased from 1% to 100% for 0.5-5 [mu]m diameter particles. Deposition agreed with the upper limit of alveolar deposition predicted by the one-dimensional (1D) ICRP66 model but only after accounting for multibreath. The 2D model showed that, for each particle size and structure orientation, there was a large heterogeneity in deposition among ducts. Differences of more than one order of magnitude were found between deposition in a single duct of a given generation and the average deposition in that generation. The presence of "hot spots" may have important implications in human health as several studies suggest a strong correlation between airborne pollutants and the onset of pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases.},

Gas flow corresponding to a mouth flow rate of 500 mls-1 was computed in a symmetric 6-generation structure of alveolated ducts located in a vertical plane. A bolus of 2 [mu]m-diameter particles was introduced in the model at the beginning of inspiration. Particle trajectories were predicted for one breath cycle (2 s inspiration, 2 s expiration). There were large non-uniformities in deposition between generations, between ducts of a given generation and within each alveolated duct, suggesting that local aerosol concentrations can be much larger than the mean acinar concentration. A significant number of particles failed to exit the structure during expiration. Most of these particles were located deep in the structure (distal to the 3rd generation), leaving them in a position to penetrate deeper in the lung during the subsequent inspiration and eventually deposit.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the effect of gravitational sedimentation on the dispersion of 0.5 and 1Â [mu]m-diameter particle boluses within a two-dimensional symmetric six-generation model of the human acinus. Boluses were introduced at the beginning of a 2-s inspiration immediately followed by a 4-s expiration, in normal gravity (1G) and in the absence of gravity (0G). The flow corresponded to a flow rate at the mouth of 500Â ml/s. In 0G, simulated dispersion (Hsim) was 16Â ml for both particle sizes. In 1G, Hsim was 71 and 242Â ml for 0.5 and 1Â [mu]m-diameter particles, respectively, showing the effect of gravitational sedimentation. The difference between experimental data (J. Appl. Physiol. 86 (1999) 1402) and simulations was independent of particle size. This suggests that the residual dispersion was independent of the intrinsic properties of the particles and was more likely due to other mechanisms such as ventilation inhomogeneities, cardiogenic oscillations and alveolar wall motion.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, CFD simulations of fibrous particle deposition in different realistic human nasal cavities were performed. The airflow field in the cavity was evaluated by solving the Navierâ€“Stokes and continuity equations using commercial software, while a Lagrangian trajectory analysis approach for solving the coupled translational and rotational equations of motion of ellipsoids was developed and used to investigate fiber transport and deposition in the nasal passages. Different breathing rates in the laminar flow regime in the nose and a range of fiber lengths and diameters were used in these simulations. It was shown that the aerodynamic diameter based on the Stokes equivalent diameter is an appropriate parameter for correlating the fiber deposition rate. Presenting the deposition fraction results versus the Stokes-based and pressure-based impaction parameters collapsed the results of different cases for various nose models roughly to a single curve. The simulated regional fiber deposition results were also presented for different nasal cavities. A simple approach developed earlier for modeling non-spherical particles using the shape factor in the drag force was also studied, and the resulting deposition fraction was compared with the present coupled translationalâ€“rotational trajectory analysis approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) have emerged as a popular alternative for the treatment of sleep-disordered breathing. These devices bring the mandibula forward in order to increase upper airway (UA) volume and prevent total UA collapse during sleep. However, the precise mechanism of action appears to be quite complex and is not yet completely understood; this might explain interindividual variation in treatment success. We examined whether an UA model, that combines imaging techniques and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), allows for a prediction of the treatment outcome with MADs. Ten patients that were treated with a custom-made mandibular advancement device (MAD), underwent split-night polysomnography. The morning after the sleep study, a low radiation dose CT scan was scheduled with and without the MAD. The CT examinations allowed for a comparison between the change in UA volume and the anatomical characteristics through the conversion to three-dimensional computer models. Furthermore, the change in UA resistance could be calculated through flow simulations with CFD. Boundary conditions for the model such as mass flow rate and pressure distributions were obtained during the split-night polysomnography. Therefore, the flow modeling was based on a patient specific geometry and patient specific boundary conditions. The results indicated that a decrease in UA resistance and an increase in UA volume correlate with both a clinical and an objective improvement. The results of this pilot study suggest that the outcome of MAD treatment can be predicted using the described UA model.},

  Abstract                 = {The deposition of monodisperse aerosols entering an idealized oral cavity geometry through a variety of inlets was experimentally measured. Aerosol particles with diameters of 2.5, 3.8 and 5.0 [mu]m were investigated at flow rates ranging from 15 to 90 L/min. The tested inlets ranged in diameter from 3 to 17 mm and included contraction nozzles, straight tubes, a turbulence generator and six commercially available dry powder inhalers (DPIs). A model for predicting the oral cavity deposition was derived from the data based on the particle Stokes number near the primary impaction location modified to incorporate the turbulent kinetic energy at the inlet. The model predicted similar (but slightly underestimated) deposition for monodisperse aerosols entering through DPIs, with increasing deposition for decreasing inlet diameter.

Each manoeuvre produced many hundreds of droplets of a range of size, the vast majority being less than 1Â mm diameter. Droplets under 1Â mm dia. travelled over 1Â m - much further than could be expected if their flight was ballistic, like that of impact spatter.

  Abstract                 = {Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are an important new class of technological materials that have numerous novel and useful properties. The forecast increase in manufacture makes it likely that increasing human exposure will occur, and as a result, CNT are beginning to come under toxicological scrutiny. This review seeks to set out the toxicological paradigms applicable to the toxicity of inhaled CNT, building on the toxicological database on nanoparticles (NP) and fibers. Relevant workplace regulation regarding exposure is also considered in the light of our knowledge of CNT. CNT could have features of both NP and conventional fibers, and so the current paradigm for fiber toxicology, which is based on mineral fibers and synthetic vitreous fibers, is discussed. The NP toxicology paradigm is also discussed in relation to CNT. The available peer-reviewed literature suggests that CNT may have unusual toxicity properties. In particular, CNT seem to have a special ability to stimulate mesenchymal cell growth and to cause granuloma formation and fibrogenesis. In several studies, CNT have more adverse effects than the same mass of NP carbon and quartz, the latter a commonly used benchmark of particle toxicity. There is, however, no definitive inhalation study available that would avoid the potential for artifactual effects due to large mats and aggregates forming during instillation exposure procedures. Studies also show that CNT may exhibit some of their effects through oxidative stress and inflammation. CNT represent a group of particles that are growing in production and use, and therefore, research into their toxicology and safe use is warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {Current approaches to model nasal airflow are reviewed in this study, and new findings presented. These new results make use of improvements to computational and experimental techniques and resources, which now allow key dynamical features to be investigated, and offer rational procedures to relate variations in anatomical form. Specifically, both replica and simplified airways of a single subject were investigated and compared with the replica airways of two other individuals with overtly differing geometries. Procedures to characterize and compare complex nasal airway geometry are first outlined. It is then shown that coupled computational and experimental studies, capable of obtaining highly resolved data, reveal internal flow structures in both intrinsically steady and unsteady situations. The results presented demonstrate that the intimate relation between nasal form and flow can be explored in greater detail than hitherto possible. By outlining means to compare complex airway geometries and demonstrating the effects of rational geometric simplification on the flow structure, this work offers a fresh approach to studies of how natural conduits guide and control flow. The concepts and tools address issues that are thus generic to flow studies in other physiological systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Current approaches to model nasal airflow are reviewed in this study, and new findings presented. These new results make use of improvements to computational and experimental techniques and resources, which now allow key dynamical features to be investigated, and offer rational procedures to relate variations in anatomical form. Specifically, both replica and simplified airways of a single subject were investigated and compared with the replica airways of two other individuals with overtly differing geometries. Procedures to characterize and compare complex nasal airway geometry are first outlined. It is then shown that coupled computational and experimental studies, capable of obtaining highly resolved data, reveal internal flow structures in both intrinsically steady and unsteady situations. The results presented demonstrate that the intimate relation between nasal form and flow can be explored in greater detail than hitherto possible. By outlining means to compare complex airway geometries and demonstrating the effects of rational geometric simplification on the flow structure, this work offers a fresh approach to studies of how natural conduits guide and control flow. The concepts and tools address issues that are thus generic to flow studies in other physiological systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanics of airflow in the human nasal airways is reviewed, drawing on the findings of experimental and computational model studies. Modelling inevitably requires simplifications and assumptions, particularly given the complexity of the nasal airways. The processes entailed in modelling the nasal airways (from defining the model, to its production and, finally, validating the results) is critically examined, both for physical models and for computational simulations. Uncertainty still surrounds the appropriateness of the various assumptions made in modelling, particularly with regard to the nature of flow. New results are presented in which high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) and direct numerical simulation are applied to investigate the development of flow instability in the nasal cavity. These illustrate some of the improved capabilities afforded by technological developments for future model studies. The need for further improvements in characterising airway geometry and flow together with promising new methods are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Decreased olfactory function is very common in the older population, being present in over half of those between the ages of 65 and 80 years and in over three quarters of those over the age of 80 years. Such dysfunction significantly influences physical well-being and quality of life, nutrition, the enjoyment of food, as well as everyday safety. Indeed a disproportionate number of the elderly die in accident gas poisonings each year. As described in this review, multiple factors contribute to such age-related loss, including altered nasal engorgement, increased propensity for nasal disease, cumulative damage to the olfactory epithelium from viral and other environmental insults, decrements in mucosal metabolizing enzymes, ossification of cribriform plate foramina, loss of selectivity of receptor cells to odorants, changes in neurotransmitter and neuromodulator systems, and neuronal expression of aberrant proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease. It is now well established that decreased smell loss can be an early sign of such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease and sporadic Parkinson's disease. In this review we provide an overview of the anatomy and physiology of the aging olfactory system, how this system is clinically evaluated, and the multiple pathophysiological factors that are associated with its dysfunction.},

  Abstract                 = {This review describes the phenomenon of the nasal cycle, which consists of periodic congestion and decongestion of the nasal venous sinusoids. The hypothesis is put forward that the nasal venous sinusoids participate in respiratory defence by generation of plasma exudate. This hypothesis is based on recent studies, which have shown that the nasal venous sinusoids have a fenestrated endothelium and that the nasal cycle is increased during periods of nasal infection; and also on a series of older observations in the literature, which link the generation of nasal fluid to the decongestion of nasal venous sinusoids. It is proposed that the periodic congestion and decongestion of nasal venous sinusoids may provide a pump mechanism for the generation of plasma exudate, and that this mechanism is an important component of respiratory defence.},

The pattern of breathing was quantified breath by breath in terms of classical respiratory variables (tidal volume and inspiratory and expiratory times), and the shape of the entire airflow profile was quantified by harmonic analysis. Statistical tests were used to compare the within-individual with the between-individual variations. In comparing the sea level vs. altitude rest (16% increase in ventilation) and sea level vs. altitude exercise (40% increase in ventilation) airflow profiles, we found a significantly greater resemblance within the individual than between individuals. Comparisons of sea level rest and exercise (295% increase in ventilation) and altitude rest and exercise (375% increase in ventilation) revealed no similarity within individuals. Despite airflow profile changes between rest and exercise, it is still possible to attest to a diversity of flow profile between individuals during exercise. Hypoxia at rest or during exercise does not alter the phenomenon of the individuality of breathing patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {The nose is the front line defender of the respiratory system and is rich with mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, and nerve endings. A time-dependent computational model of transport through nasal models of a healthy human has been used to analyze the fields of physical stresses that may develop at the air-wall interface of the nasal mucosa. Simulations during quiet breathing revealed wall shear stresses as high as 0.3 Pa in the noselike model and 1.5 Pa in the anatomical model. These values are of the same order of those known to exist in uniform large arteries. The distribution of temperature near the nasal wall at peak inspiration is similar to that of wall shear stresses. The lowest temperatures occur in the vicinity of high stresses due to the narrow passageway in these locations. Time and spatial gradients of these stresses may have functional effects on nasal sensation of airflow and may play a role in the well-being of nasal breathing.},

  Abstract                 = {Direct and Large-Eddy simulations are conducted in a fin bank with dimples and protrusions over a Reynolds number range of ReHÂ =Â 200 to 15,000, encompassing laminar, transitional and fully turbulent regimes. Two dimple-protrusion geometries are studied in which the same imprint pattern is investigated for two different channel heights or fin pitches, Case 1 with twice the fin pitch of Case 2. The smaller fin pitch configuration (Case 2) develops flow instabilities at ReHÂ =Â 450, whereas Case 1 undergoes transition at ReHÂ =Â 900. Case 2, exhibits higher Nusselt numbers and friction coefficients in the low Reynolds number regime before Case 1 transitions to turbulence, after which, the differences between the two decreases considerably in the fully turbulent regime. Vorticity generated within the dimple cavity and at the dimple rim contribute substantially to heat transfer augmentation on the dimple side, whereas flow impingement and acceleration between protrusions contribute substantially on the protrusion side. While friction drag dominates losses in Case 1 at low Reynolds numbers, both form and friction drag contributed equally in Case 2. As the Reynolds number increases to fully turbulent flow, form drag dominates in both cases, contributing about 80% to the total losses. While both geometries are viable and competitive with other augmentation surfaces in the turbulent regime, Case 2 with larger feature sizes with respect to the fin pitch is more appropriate in the low Reynolds number regime ReHÂ <Â 2000, which makes up most of the operating range of typical compact heat exchangers.},

  Abstract                 = {Large airway measurement is clinically important in cases of airway disease and trauma. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT), which allows for airway measurement. However, the ionizing radiation dose associated with CT is a major limitation in longitudinal studies and trauma. To avoid ionizing radiation from CT, we present a method for measuring the large airway diameter in humans using hyperpolarized helium-3 (HPHe) MRI in conjunction with a dynamic 3D radial acquisition. An algorithm is introduced which utilizes the significant airway contrast for semi-automated segmentation and skeletonization which is used to derive the airway lumen diameter. The HPHe MRI method was validated with quantitative CT in an excised and desiccated porcine lung (linear regression R 2 = 0.974 and slope = 0.966 over 32 airway segments). The airway lumen diameters were then compared in 24 human subjects (22 asthmatics and 2 normals; linear regression R 2 value of 0.799 and slope = 0.768 over 309 airway segments). The feasibility for airway path analysis to areas of ventilation defect is also demonstrated.},

Maximum flame temperature has been measured using a high-resolution spectrometer operating in the visible range. Analysis of combustion residual shows that nanoparticles combustion is realized via the gas-phase mechanism. A three-stage particle combustion model has been proposed based on these observations. Model parameters have been fitted to match the experimental results on the flame velocity and maximum temperature. Particle burning time is estimated from the flame simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider in this study the mixed convection airflow encountered in a 3D anisothermal cavity ventilated with supply and exhaust slots under stable thermal stratification. The flow in this cavity has been experimentally studied in the past (S. Mergui, CaractÃ©risation expÃ©rimentale des Ã©coulements d'air de convection naturelle et mixte dans une cavitÃ© fermÃ©e, thÃ¨se de l'UniversitÃ© de Poitiers, France, 1993) and was subject to a jet deflection and to a sudden change in the flow pattern between a general clockwise rotation and a counter-clockwise rotation when varying the inlet jet velocity. This phenomenon also exhibits a hysteresis effect depending on the way the velocity is changed, which made us to think that this flow bifurcation is of subcritical nature. Numerical studies have been yet devoted to this configuration, using RANS simulations or Large Eddy Simulation (LES), but this phenomenon has not been reported. So, we chose to numerically study this challenging flow with an LES approach associated with a subgrid diffusivity model previously developed for natural convection airflows. The comparison with the available experimental data and with other LES results using a classical dynamic model proves that the present LES not only correctly predicts the mean characteristics of the flow but is also able to correctly reproduce the flow bifurcation and the hysterisis effect.},

Patients presenting with influenza-like-illness, confirmed influenza A or B virus by rapid test, and onset within 3 days were recruited at three clinics in Hong Kong, China. We collected exhaled breath from each subject onto Teflon filters and measured exhaled particle concentrations using an optical particle counter. Filters were analyzed for influenza A and B viruses by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Twelve out of thirteen rapid test positive patients provided exhaled breath filter samples (7 subjects infected with influenza B virus and 5 subjects infected with influenza A virus). We detected influenza virus RNA in the exhaled breath of 4 (33%) subjectsâ€“three (60%) of the five patients infected with influenza A virus and one (14%) of the seven infected with influenza B virus. Exhaled influenza virus RNA generation rates ranged from &lt;3.2 to 20 influenza virus RNA particles per minute.

User-enhanced commercial codes and self-developed software was used to compute the air velocity field as well as particle deposition distributions for a large size range of inhalable particles. The numerical model was validated by comparison of our results with experimental flow measurements and particle deposition data available in the open literature. Our simulations show highly localised deposition patterns for all particle sizes, but mainly for the larger particles. As expected, deposition efficiencies and deposition fractions proved to be very sensitive to the particle size. The deposition density in the hot spots can be hundreds and even thousand times higher than the mean deposition density. Present results can be of interest to researchers involved in the assessment of adverse health effects of inhaled aerosols or optimising the drug aerosol delivery into the lung.},

  Abstract                 = {Investigation of the effect of sidewall and carinal tumours, airway constrictions and airway blockage on the inspiratory airflow and particle deposition in the large central human airways was the primary objective of this study. A computational fluid and particle dynamics model was implemented, validated and applied in order to simulate the air and particle transport and to quantify the aerosol deposition in double airway bifurcation models. Our investigations revealed that surface abnormalities and tubular constrictions can significantly alter the airstreams and the related local aerosol deposition distributions. Sidewall tumours have lead to an enhanced deposition of large particles and caused lower deposition efficiency values of nano-particles compared to the deposition efficiency in healthy airways. Central tumours multiplied the deposition efficiency of large particles but hardly affected the deposition efficiency of nano-particles. Airway blockage caused a significant redistribution of particle deposition sites. The deposition efficiency of the inhaled aerosols in constricted airways was much higher than the same deposition efficiency in healthy airways. Current results might help in the understanding of the adverse health effects of the inhaled air-pollutants in patients with lung disease and might be integrated into future aerosol therapy protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {Solar-induced cutaneous changes are more prevalent and profound in older persons and, thus, are often inappropriately attributed to the aging process, per se. Structural and functional alterations caused by intrinsic aging and independent of environmental insults are now recognized in the skin of elderly individuals. Structurally the aged epidermis likely becomes thinner, the corneocytes become less adherent to one another, and there is flattening of the dermoepidermal interface. The number of melanocytes and Langerhans cells is decreased. The dermis becomes atrophic and it is relatively acellular and avascular. Dermal collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans are altered. The subcutaneous tissue is diminished in some areas, especially the face, shins, hands, and feet, while in others, particularly the abdomen in men and the thighs in women, it is increased. The number of eccrine glands is reduced and both the eccrine and apocrine glands undergo attenuation. Sebaceous glands tend to increase in size but paradoxically their secretory output is lessened, The nail plate is generally thinned, the surface ridged and lusterless, and the lunula decreased in size. There is a progressive reduction in the density of hair follicles per unit area on the face and scalp, independent of male-pattern alopecia. The hair shaft diameter is generally reduced but in some areas, especially the ears, nose, and eyebrows of men and the upper lip and chin in women, it is increased as vellus hairs convert to cosmetically compromising terminal hairs. Functional alterations noted in the skin of elderly persons include a decreased growth rate of the epidermis, hair, and nails, delayed wound healing, reduced dermal clearance of fluids and foreign materials, and compromised vascular responsiveness. Eccrine and apocrine secretions are diminished. The cutaneous immune and inflammatory responses are impaired, particularly cell-mediated immunity. Clinical correlates of these intrinsic aging changes of the skin include alopecia, pallor, xerosis, an increased number of benign and malignant epidermal neoplasms, increased susceptibility to blister formation, predisposition to injury of the dermis and underlying tissues, delayed onset and resolution of blisters and wheals, persistent contact dermatitis, impaired tanning response to ultraviolet light, increased risk for wound infections, prolongation of therapy necessary for onychomycosis, and thermoregulatory disturbances.},

  Abstract                 = {Concepts of turbulent flow control have become of growing importance during the last few years, following increased interest in the detailed structural scenario of turbulence--in particular our improved understanding of coherent structures on the one hand (the prerequisite), and a need for improvement of technological processes on the other (the goal). These considerations have mainly been followed by engineers and physicists concerned with problems in aerodynamics. It is our aim to draw the attention of a wider group of engineers to turbulent flow control in order to speed up the transfer of knowledge from aerodynamics to applications in other fields of engineering. In this paper an attempt is made to compile a major body of the available knowledge on flow control in separated and wall bounded turbulent flows. After a brief introduction of the basics of control theory (Section 2) and of the major flow structures and their stability characteristics (Section 3) free and wall bounded turbulent shear flows are discussed (Sections 4 and 5). This discussion summarizes the main relationships between structure and flow behaviour and shows possibilities of influencing properties of these flows such as increasing mixing or avoiding separation.},

  Abstract                 = {The lattice Boltzmann method is used to calculate the incompressible, viscous flow of air through a model of a nasal cavity, used in experiments. Computations are performed for steady flows at the inspiration and expiration phase of nose breathing. Computed pressure distributions and friction coefficients compare well with Navier-Stokes solutions from a finite-volume method on structured, curvilinear grids. The comparison with conventional Navier-Stokes solvers shows several advantages of the lattice Boltzmann method in particular for bio-medical flow problems. These are the fast grid generation, the simple, granular algorithm, suited for efficient parallelization and the high flexibility for implementing complex boundary conditions and additional transport equations. Lattice Boltzmann methods are therefore efficient candidates for fast flow predictions in the frame of computer-aided rhino-surgery.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative methods for comparing intranasal drug delivery efficiencies pre- and postoperatively have not been fully utilized. The objective of this study is to use computational fluid dynamics techniques to evaluate aqueous nasal spray penetration efficiencies before and after surgical correction of intranasal anatomic deformities. METHODS: Ten three-dimensional models of the nasal cavities were created from pre- and postoperative computed tomography scans in 5 subjects. Spray simulations were conducted using a particle size distribution ranging from 10 mum to 110 mum, a spray speed of 3 m/second, plume angle of 68 degrees, and with steady state, resting inspiratory airflow present. Two different nozzle positions were compared. Statistical analysis was conducted using Student t test for matched pairs. RESULTS: On the obstructed side, posterior particle deposition after surgery increased by 118% and was statistically significant (p = 0.036), while anterior particle deposition decreased by 13% and was also statistically significant (p = 0.020). The fraction of particles that bypassed the airways either pre- or postoperatively was less than 5%. Posterior particle deposition differences between obstructed and contralateral sides of the airways were 113% and 30% for pre- and postsurgery, respectively. Results showed that nozzle positions can influence spray delivery. CONCLUSION: Simulations predicted that surgical correction of nasal anatomic deformities can improve spray penetration to areas where medications can have greater effect. Particle deposition patterns between both sides of the airways are more evenly distributed after surgery. These findings suggest that correcting anatomic deformities may improve intranasal medication delivery. For enhanced particle penetration, patients with nasal deformities may explore different nozzle positions. (c) 2012 ARS-AAOA, LLC.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective. To study the effects of nasal deformity on aerosol penetration past the nasal valve (NV) for varying particle sizes using sprays or nebulizers. Study Design. Computed mathematical nasal airway model. Setting. Department computer lab. Subjects and Methods. Particle deposition was analyzed using a computational fluid dynamics model of the human nose with leftward septal deviation and compensatory right inferior turbinate hypertrophy. Sprays were simulated for 10 Âµm, 20 Âµm, 50 Âµm, or particle sizes following a Rosin Rammler particle size distribution (10-110 Âµm), at speeds of 1, 3, or 10 meters per second. Nebulization was simulated for 1, 3.2, 6.42, or 10 Âµm particles. Steady state inspiratory airflow was simulated at 15.7 liters per minute. Results. Sprays predicted higher NV penetration on the right side for particle sizes >10 Âµm, with comparable penetration on both sides at 10 Âµm. Nearly 100% deposited in the nasal passages for all spray characteristics. Nebulizer predictions showed nearly 100% of particles <6.42 Âµm and more than 50% of 6.42 Âµm bypassing both sides of the nose without depositing. Of the nebulized particles that deposited, penetration was higher on the right at 10 Âµm, with comparable penetration on both sides at 6.42 Âµm. Spray penetration was highest at 10 Âµm, with more than 96% penetrating on both sides at 1 and 3 meters per second. Nebulization penetration was also highest at 10 Âµm (40% on the left, >90% on the right). Conclusion. In the presence of a septal deviation, sprays or nebulizers containing 10-Âµm particles may have good penetration beyond the NV. Nebulized particles <10 Âµm are likely to be respirable. Additionally, spray speeds above 3 meters per second may limit penetration.},

  Abstract                 = {Epidemiological studies of occupational exposure to formaldehyde gas (HCHO) have suggested possible links between concentration and duration of exposure, and elevated risks of leukaemia and other cancers at sites distant from the site of contact. Formaldehyde is a highly water soluble gas which, when inhaled, reacts rapidly at the site of contact and is quickly metabolised by enzymes in the respiratory tissue. Inhaled formaldehyde is almost entirely absorbed in the respiratory tract and, for formaldehyde induced toxicity to occur at distant sites, HCHO must enter the blood and be transported to systemic tissues via the circulatory system. A mathematical model describing the absorption and removal of inhaled formaldehyde in the nasal tissue is therefore formulated to predict the proportion of formaldehyde entering into the blood. Accounting for the spatial distribution of the formaldehyde concentration and the metabolic activity within the mucosa, the concentration of formaldehyde in the mucus, the epithelium and the blood has been determined and was found to attain a steady-state profile within a few seconds of exposure. The increase of the formaldehyde concentration in the blood was predicted to be insignificant compared with the existing pre-exposure levels in the body, indicating that formaldehyde is rapidly removed in the nasal tissue. The results of the model thus suggest that it is highly unlikely that following inhalation by the nose, formaldehyde itself will cause toxicity at sites other than the initial site of contact in the respiratory tract.},

  Abstract                 = {Compared to younger subjects, older people have a reduced sensitivity of the intranasal trigeminal system which responds to irritation of the nasal cavity. It is unclear whether the cause of this difference relates to age-dependent changes in the periphery of the system. The aim of the present study was the comparison of intranasal trigeminal thresholds assessed through electrophysiological measurements in eight young (four women, four men; mean age 25 years) and eight older subjects (four women, four men; mean age 62 years). The negative mucosa potential (NMP), a peripheral correlate of trigeminal activation, was recorded from the nasal mucosa in response to stimulation with varying concentrations of the mixed olfactory/trigeminal stimulants menthol and linalool. Thresholds were estimated as the strongest concentration which did not elicit a \{NMP\} response. Older subjects were found to have higher thresholds for menthol when compared to younger subjects. Furthermore, an explorative analysis indicated that the increase of response amplitudes to increasing stimulus concentrations was shallower in older subjects. These findings indicate that age related loss of intranasal trigeminal sensitivity seems to take place, at least to some degree, in the periphery of the intranasal trigeminal system. },

  Abstract                 = {Numerous inhalation studies have demonstrated that exposure to high concentrations of a wide range of volatile acids and esters results in cytotoxicity to the nasal olfactory epithelium. Previously, a hybrid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) dosimetry model was constructed to estimate the regional tissue dose of organic acids in the rodent and human nasal cavity. This study extends this methodology to a representative volatile organic ester, ethyl acrylate (EA). An in vitro exposure of explants of rat olfactory epithelium to EA with and without an esterase inhibitor demonstrated that the organic acid, acrylic acid, released by nasal esterases is primarily responsible for the olfactory cytotoxicity. Estimates of the steady-state concentration of acrylic acid in olfactory tissue were made for the rat nasal cavity by using data from a series of short-term in vivo studies and from the results of CFD-PBPK computer modeling. Appropriate parameterization of the CFD-PBPK model for the human nasal cavity and to accommodate human systemic anatomy, metabolism, and physiology allowed interspecies dose comparisons. The CFD-PBPK model simulations indicate that the olfactory epithelium of the human nasal cavity is exposed to at least 18-fold lower tissue concentrations of acid released from EA than the olfactory epithelium of the rat nasal cavity under the same exposure conditions. The magnitude of this difference varies with the specific exposure scenario that is simulated and with the specific dataset of human esterase activity used for the simulations. The increased olfactory tissue dose in rats relative to humans may be attributed to both the vulnerable location of the rodent olfactory tissue (comprising greater than 50% of the nasal cavity) and the high concentration of rat olfactory esterase activity (comparable to liver esterase activity) relative to human olfactory tissue. These studies suggest that the human olfactory epithelium is protected from vapors of organic esters significantly better than rat olfactory epithelium due to substantive differences in nasal anatomy, nasal and systemic metabolism, systemic physiology, and air flow. Although the accumulation of acrylic acid in the nasal tissues may be a primary concern for nasal irritation and human risk assessment, acute animal inhalation studies to evaluate lethality (LD50-type studies) conducted at very high vapor concentrations of ethyl acrylate indicated that a different mechanism is primarily responsible for mortality. The rodent studies demonstrated that systemic tissue nonprotein sulfhydryl depletion is a primary cause of death at exposure concentrations more than two orders of magnitude above the concentrations that induce nasal irritation. The CFD-PBPK model adequately simulated the severe depletion of glutathione in systemic tissues (e.g., liver and lung) associated with acute inhalation exposures in the 500-1000 ppm range. These results indicate that the CFD-PBPK model can simulate both the low-dose nasal tissue dosimetry associated with irritation and the high-dose systemic tissue dosimetry associated with mortality. In addition, the comparison of simulation results for ethyl acetate and acetone to nasal deposition data suggests that the CFD-PBPK model has general utility as a tool for dosimetry estimates for a wide range of other esters and slowly metabolized vapors.},

  Abstract                 = {Objectives: Wood dust data held in the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) National Exposure DataBase (NEDB) were reviewed to investigate the long-term changes in inhalation exposure from 1985 to 2005. In addition, follow-up sampling measurements were obtained from selected companies where exposure measurements had been collected prior to 1994, thereby providing a follow-up period of at least 10 years, to determine whether changes in exposure levels had occurred, with key staff being interviewed to identify factors that might be responsible for any changes observed.Methods: Analysis of the temporal trend in exposure concentrations was performed using Linear Mixed Effect Models on the log-transformed NEDB data set and expressed as the relative annual change in concentration.Results: For the NEDB wood dust data, an annual decline of geometric mean (GM) exposure of 8.1% per year was found based on 1459 exposure measurements collected between 1985 and 2003. This trend was predominantly observed in data from inspection visits (measurements collected on a mandatory basis by a Specialist HSE Inspector) (n = 1009), while data from representative surveys (measurements collected on a voluntary basis to provide information on current practices and exposures) remained relatively stable. Ten follow-up surveys in individual workplaces in 2004â€“2005 resulted in 70 new measurements and for each of the companies resurveyed, the GM of the wood dust exposure decreased between sampling surveys.Conclusion: Analysis of the temporal trend in UK wood dust exposure concentrations revealed declines of 8% per annum. Interviews with key long-serving employees and management suggest that factors such as technological changes in production processes, response to new legislation, and enforcement agency inspections, together with global economic trends, could be linked to the downward trends observed.},

The transient processes of forming an air cavity around the jet, capturing an initially large air bubble, and the break-up of this large toroidal-shaped bubble into smaller bubbles were analyzed. A stabilized finite element method (FEM) was employed under parallel numerical simulations based on adaptive, unstructured grid and coupled with a level-set method to track the interface between air and liquid. These simulations show that the inertia of the liquid jet initially depresses the pool's surface, forming an annular air cavity which surrounds the liquid jet. A toroidal liquid eddy which is subsequently formed in the liquid pool results in air cavity collapse, and in turn entrains air into the liquid pool from the unstable annular air gap region around the liquid jet.},

  Abstract                 = {The geometry of arterial conduits derived from in vivo image data is subject to acquisition and reconstruction errors. This results in a degree of uncertainty in defining the bounding geometry for a patient-specific anatomical conduit. In applying computational fluid dynamics to model the flow in specific anatomical configurations, the effect of the uncertainty in boundary definition should be considered, particularly if the objective is to extract quantitative measures of the local haemodynamics. Taking an example of a bypass graft configuration, we examine the effects of image threshold, surface smoothing and semi-idealization on the modelled geometry and the resulting flow. Procedures for reconstruction from medical images are outlined and applied with different parameter values within the image uncertainty range to create alternative models from the same data set. Methods to characterize the flow structure and wall shear stress (WSS) are introduced and used to provide quantitative comparison of the different haemodynamic environments associated with the varying model geometries. Comparable effects on the WSS distribution are found to occur with progressively increased surface smoothing and semi-idealization of the geometry by elliptical section fitting. Significant differences in WSS correspond to different threshold choices. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Patient-specific studies of physiological flows rely on anatomically realistic or idealized models. Objective comparison of datasets or the relation of specific to idealized geometries has largely been performed in an ad hoc manner. Here, two rational procedures (based respectively on Fourier descriptors and medial axis (MA) transforms) are presented; each provides a compact representation of a complex anatomical region, specifically the nasal airways. The techniques are extended to furnish average geometries. These retain a sensible anatomical form, facilitating the identification of a specific anatomy as a set of weighted perturbations about the average. Both representations enable a rapid translation of the surface description into a virtual model for computation of airflow, enabling future work to comprehensively investigate the relation between anatomic form and flow-associated function, for the airways or for other complex biological conduits. The methodology based on MA transforms is shown to allow flexible geometric modeling, as illustrated by a local alteration in airway patency. Computational simulations of steady inspiratory flow are used to explore the relation between the flow in individual vs. averaged anatomical geometries. Results show characteristic flow measures of the averaged geometries to be within the range obtained from the original three subjects, irrespective of averaging procedure. However the effective regularization of anatomic form resulting from the shape averaging was found to significantly reduce trans-nasal pressure loss and the mean shear stress in the cavity. It is suggested that this may have implications in attempts to relate model geometries and flow patterns that are broadly representative.},

  Abstract                 = {Procedures capable of providing both compact representations and rational simplifications of complex anatomical flow conduits are essential to explore how form and function are related in the respiratory, cardiovascular and other physiological flow systems. This study focuses on flow in the human nasal cavity. Methods to derive the cavity wall boundary from medical images are first outlined. Anisotropic smoothing of the boundary surface is shown to provide less geometric distortion in regions of high curvature, such as at the ends of the narrow nasal passages. A reversible decomposition of the surface into a stack of planar contours is then effected using an implicit function formulation. Fourier descriptors provide a continuous representation of each contour as a modal expansion and permit simplification of the geometry by retaining only dominant modes via filtering. Computations of the steady inspiratory flow field are performed for replica and reduced geometries, where reduced geometry is derived by retaining only the first 15 modes in the expansion of each slice contour. The overall pressure drop and integrated wall shear are shown to be virtually unaffected by simplification. More sensitive measures, such as the Lagrangian particle trajectories and residence time distributions, show slight changes as discussed. Comparison of the Fourier descriptor method applied to three different patient data sets indicates the potential of the technique as a means to characterize complex flow conduit geometry, and the scope for further work is outlined.

  Abstract                 = {Burning of polymer matrix composites in postcrash aircraft fires generates a complex mixture of combustion products comprised of gases, organic vapors, and particulate matter including airborne carbon fibers. There is concern among the fire fighting, investigative, and mishap response communities that an unusual health hazard is posed by this combination of combustion products. This paper presents an overview of the nature and potential hazards of acute exposure to airborne carbon fibers from fire and explosion involving advanced composites ma terials. Data from fire tests and crash-site investigations suggest that a small frac tion of the fibers released in fires are respirable and can be inhaled deep into the lung. Most of the carbon fibers produced in fires are 2-10 times larger than the criti cal fiber size associated with asbestos toxicity, and their concentration is well below OSHA recommended levels for chronic exposure. At issue however are the toxico logical effects of adsorbed combustion products. Chemical extraction shows that a large number of toxic organic compounds are adsorbed on these fibers, several of which are known carcinogens and mutagens in animals. At the present time there is no conclusive evidence linking airborne fibers from burning composites to any un usual health hazard. However, no toxicological studies have been conducted to as sess the long-term health effects from exposure to a single high dose of fibrous particulates and any synergistic interactions with the organic chemicals.},

  Abstract                 = {Atrophic rhinitis is a chronic disease of the nasal mucosa. The disease is characterized by abnormally wide nasal cavities, and its main symptoms are dryness, crusting, atrophy, fetor, and a paradoxical sensation of nasal congestion. The etiology of the disease remains unknown. Here, we propose that excessive evaporation of the mucous layer is the basis for the relentless nature of this disease. Airflow and water and heat transport were simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The nasal geometry of an atrophic rhinitis patient was acquired from computed tomography scans before and after a procedure to narrow the nasal cavity. Simulations of air conditioning in the atrophic nose were compared with similar computations performed within the nasal geometries of four healthy humans. The excessively wide cavity of the patient generated abnormal flow patterns, which led to abnormal patterns of water fluxes across the wall. Geometrically, the atrophic nose had a much lower surface area than the healthy nasal passages, which increased water fluxes per unit area. Nevertheless, the simulations indicated that the atrophic nose did not condition inspired air as effectively as the healthy geometries. These simulations of water transport in the nasal cavity are consistent with the hypothesis that excessive evaporation of mucus plays a key role in the pathophysiology of atrophic rhinitis. We conclude that the main goals of a surgery to treat atrophic rhinitis should be 1) to restore the original surface area of the nose, 2) to restore the physiological airflow distribution, and 3) to create symmetric cavities.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Interindividual variability in nasal filtration is significant due to interindividual differences in nasal anatomy and breathing rate. Two important consequences arise from this variation among humans. First, devices for nasal drug delivery may furnish quite different doses in the nasal passages of different individuals, leading to different responses to therapeutic treatment. Second, people with poor nasal filtration may be more susceptible to adverse health effects when exposed to airborne particulate matter (PM) due to greater lung deposition. Although interindividual variability of nasal filtration has been reported by several authors, a relationship for predicting filtration efficiency from nasal anatomy and ventilation is still lacking. Such a relationship is needed to (1) devise nasal drug delivery systems and (2) define limits of exposure to PM that are effective for the human population at large. Methods: Anatomically correct nasal replicas of five adults (four healthy individuals and one atrophic rhinitis patient) were used in aerosol experiments to measure nasal deposition of 1-12-Î¼m particles. The dependence of nasal filtration on nasal anatomy and breathing rate was investigated using various definitions of the Stokes number as well as phenomenological Impaction Parameters proposed in the literature. Results: Interindividual variability among the healthy adults was nearly eliminated when nasal filtration was plotted against a specific definition of the Stokes number or against a pressure-based Impaction Parameter. Nasal filtration in the atrophic rhinitis patient was lower than in the healthy subjects. Conclusions: The new definition of the Stokes number introduced in this study, which is based on a new definition of the characteristic diameter of the nasal passages, nearly eliminated interindividual differences in nasal filtration. Our results suggest that it is possible to estimate nasal filtering efficiency using measurements of transnasal pressure drop.},

Statistical quantities that were determined are the mean streamwise velocity, the root-mean-square of the fluctuations of the streamwise and the normal velocities, the Reynolds shear stress and higher order moments. Turbulence production is calculated from these quantities. Turbulence statistics obtained from experiments are compared with results from a direct numerical simulation at the same Reynolds number. The good agreement validates a recent DNS, at Re=5700, which is approximately twice as large as used in most previous studies.},

The phase diagrams show an UCST behaviour, increasing incompatibility as the molar mass increases. The Flory-Huggins theory with a concentration-dependent interaction parameter has been developed to study the compatibility of two polymers in presence of spherical nanoparticles. This theory has been first compared with the experimental cloud point curve in absence of nanoparticles, and secondly it has been used to predict the thermodynamic behaviour in presence of different volume fraction of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles coated with two types of functional groups have been tested. It can be concluded that the inclusion of nanoparticles increases compatibility. Moreover concentration-dependent interaction parameters have been obtained in these systems for the first time.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the problem of wake vortices shed by commercial aircraft. It presents a consolidated European view on the current status of knowledge of the nature and characteristics of aircraft wakes and of technical and operational procedures of minimizing and predicting the vortex strength and avoiding wake encounters. Methodological aspects of data evaluation and interpretation, like the description of wake ages, the characterization of wake vortices, and the proper evaluation of wake data from measurement and simulation, are addressed in the first part. In the second part an inventory of our knowledge is given on vortex characterization and control, prediction and monitoring of vortex decay, vortex detection and warning, vortex encounter models, and wake-vortex safety assessment. Each section is concluded by a list of questions and required actions which may help to guide further research activities. The primary objective of the joint international efforts in wake-vortex research is to avoid potentially hazardous wake encounters for aircraft. Shortened aircraft separations under appropriate meteorological conditions, whilst keeping or even increasing the safety level, is the ultimate goal. Reduced time delays on the tactical side and increased airport capacities on the strategic side will be the benefits of these ambitious ventures for the air transportation industry and services.},

Many papers reviewed herein relate to the science of heat transfer, including numerical, analytical and experimental works. Others relate to applications where heat transfer plays a major role not only in man-made devices, but in natural systems as well. The papers are grouped into categories and then into sub-fields within these categories. We restrict ourselves to papers published in reviewed archival journals. Besides reviewing the journal articles in the body of this paper, we also mention important conferences and meetings on heat transfer and related fields, major awards presented in 2003, and books on heat transfer published during the year.},

  Abstract                 = {An algebraic variational multiscale-multigrid method is proposed for large eddy simulation of turbulent flow. Level-transfer operators from plain aggregation algebraic multigrid methods are employed for scale separation. In contrast to earlier approaches based on geometric multigrid methods, this purely algebraic strategy for scale separation obviates any coarse discretization besides the basic one. Operators based on plain aggregation algebraic multigrid provide a projective scale separation, enabling an efficient implementation of the proposed method. The application of the algebraic variational multiscale-multigrid method to turbulent flow in a channel produces results notably closer to reference (direct numerical simulation) results than other state-of-the-art methods both for mean streamwise and root-mean-square velocities. For predicting highly sensitive components of the Reynolds-stress tensor in the context of turbulent recirculating flow in a lid-driven cavity, the algebraic variational multiscale-multigrid method also shows a remarkably good performance in predicting reference results from experiment and direct numerical simulation compared to other methods.},

  Abstract                 = {A procedure for measuring the effects of flow increase rate (FIR) on mouth-throat and downstream filter ("lung") deposition was developed. A respiratory aerosol probe (RAP) was used for generation and delivery of small aerosol boluses. This device employs computer controlled, fast opening and closing valves, which allow aerosol injection at a predetermined time during inhalation. Flow was driven by a pulmonary waveform generator (PWG) breathing machine. Monodisperse, diameter dioctylphthalate (DOP) particles were used. The following experimental flow conditions were tested: bolus injection into a steady-state flow of 30Â l/min, and bolus injection into unsteady flow accelerating through 30Â l/min at either 2 or . In addition, numerical simulation of the effects of FIR on mouth-throat deposition of aerosol boluses was performed. Our results show that unsteady flow resulted in enhanced mouth-throat deposition. This difference can be explained by the higher velocity reached by the particles at their primary deposition site within the mouth-throat due to the accelerating flow rate (which reaches approximately 40Â l/min by the time the particles deposit in the area of the larynx). This hypothesis is supported by data with bolus injection into a steady flow rate of 40Â l/min, which yields mouth-throat deposition that does not differ significantly from the unsteady case.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;In this experimental study a thorough analysis of the steady and unsteady flow field in a realistic transparent silicone lung model of the first bifurcation of the upper human airways will be presented. To determine the temporal evolution of the flow time-resolved particle-image velocimetry recordings were performed for a Womersley number range 3.3 â‰¤ Î± â‰¤ 5.8 and Reynolds numbers of Re D &nbsp;= 1,050, 1,400, and 2,100. The results evidence a highly three-dimensional and asymmetric character of the velocity field in the upper human airways, in which the influence of the asymmetric geometry of the realistic lung model plays a significant role for the development of the flow field in the respiratory system. At steady inspiration, the flow shows independent of the Reynolds number a large zone with embedded counter-rotating vortices in the left bronchia ensuring a continuous streamwise transport into the lung. At unsteady flow the critical Reynolds number, which describes the onset of vortices in the first bifurcation, is increased at higher Womersley number and decreased at higher Reynolds number.

  Abstract                 = {Large-eddy simulations of incompressible Newtonian fluid flows with approximate deconvolution models based on the van Cittert method are reported. The Legendre spectral element method is used for the spatial discretization to solve the filtered Navier-Stokes equations. A novel variant of approximate deconvolution models blended with a mixed scale model using a dynamic evaluation of the subgrid-viscosity constant is proposed. This model is validated by comparing the large-eddy simulation with the direct numerical simulation of the flow in a lid-driven cubical cavity, performed at a Reynolds number of 12,000. Subgrid modeling in the case of a flow with coexisting laminar, transitional and turbulent zones such as the lid-driven cubical cavity flow represents a challenging problem. Moreover, the coupling with the spectral element method having very low numerical dissipation and dispersion builds a well suited framework to analyze the efficiency of a subgrid model. First- and second-order statistics obtained using this new model are showing very good agreement with the direct numerical simulation. Filtering operations rely on an invertible filter applied in a modal basis and preserving the C0-continuity across elements. No clipping on dynamic parameters was needed to preserve numerical stability.},

Detailed velocity profiles for inspiratory and expiratory flow through the model and turbulence intensity were measured with a hot-film anemometer probe with 1 mm spatial resolution. Steady flow rates equivalent to 1,100, 560, and 180 ml/s through one side of the real human nose were studied. Airflows were determined to be moderately turbulent, but changes in the velocity profiles between the highest and lowest flow rates suggest that for normal breathing laminar flow may be present in much of the nasal cavity. The velocity measurements closest to the model wall were estimated to be inside the laminar sublayer, such that the slopes of the velocity profiles are reasonably good estimates of the velocity gradients at the walls. The overall longitudinal pressure drop inside the nasal cavity for the three inspiratory flow rates was estimated from the average total shear stress measured at the central nasal wall and showed good agreement with literature values measured in human subjects.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents results of a computational study conducted to assess the multi-scale resolution capabilities of a hybrid two-equation turbulence model in predicting unsteady separated high speed flows. Numerical solutions are obtained using a third order Roe scheme and the SST (shear-stress-transport) two-equation-based hybrid turbulence model for three-dimensional transonic flow over an open cavity. A detailed assessment of the effects of the computational grid and the hybrid turbulence model coefficient is presented for the unsteady flow field. Computed results are presented for both the resolved and the modeled turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and for the predicted sound pressure level (SPL) spectra, which are compared to available experimental data and large Eddy simulation (LES) results. The comparison shows that the predicted SPL spectra agree well with the experimental results over a frequency range up to 2500Â Hz, and that hybrid turbulence effectively models the shorter wavelengths. The results demonstrate improved agreement with experimental SPL spectra with increased grid resolution and a reduced hybrid turbulence model coefficient. In addition, they show that energy dissipation of the unresolved scales is over-predicted at low resolutions and that the hybrid coefficient influences the grid resolution requirements.},

  Abstract                 = {We developed two new three-dimensional models of aerosol transport and deposition representative of two generations in the alveolar zone of the human lung, one with the bifurcation area, and one without. The models were used to simulate particle trajectories of 1- particles in generations 18-22 of the human lung in different orientations with respect to gravity. Orientation had a significant effect on the overall deposition predicted, which varied by a factor of approximately 3 between the orientations with highest and lowest deposition. Total deposition was a function of orientation and the ratio of terminal settling velocity to mean lumen flow velocity. Predicted deposition was significantly greater in the model without the bifurcation than in the model with the bifurcation. We conclude that modeling the bifurcation is important due to the complex relationship between aerodynamic drag and gravitational sedimentation within the bifurcation zone.},

  Abstract                 = {The exhaled breath of humans contains droplets originating from the lung lining fluid. An analysis of these droplets for non-volatile proteinaceous biomarkers holds potential as a non-invasive diagnosis of lung diseases. To ease the interpretation of the diagnostic results, the source strength of the particles should be known und therefore an understanding of the particle generation process is required. It is assumed that during reopening of a collapsed terminal airway a liquid bridge of the lung lining fluid ruptures and droplets are generated. The objective of our experimental and theoretical study was to clarify the mechanisms of droplet generation for quiet breathing patterns by investigating in detail the number flux and the particle size distribution in the exhaled breath. The process of liquid film rupture is modelled by computational fluid dynamics analysis from which the droplet size distribution is calculated. In addition the number emission flux and the droplet size distribution are systematically measured in the exhaled breath of healthy volunteers. The strong increase of the particle emission flux with tidal volume and the good agreement between measured and calculated droplet number distribution both showing droplets primarily in the submicron range confirm the present hypothesis that reopening of collapsed airway structures associated with the rupture of a surfactant film is the physical mechanism of droplet generation. This was hypothesized previously in the literature.},

The flow is investigated for normal inspiration and expiration at Reynolds numbers based on the throat diameter of Re=500 and Re=400. The numerical method is second-order accurate on a multi-block structured grid. Flow measurements are based on the method of Digital Particle-Image Velocimetry (DPIV) in transparent nose models. The experimental results corroborate the numerical flow structure thereby evidencing that the nose flow can be considered laminar in the Reynolds number range investigated. Moreover, the analysis of the flow field indicates overall, the higher susceptibility to geometric changes at inspiration and in particular, the lower turbinate to have the major impact on the flow structure especially when air is inhaled.},

A comparison of the essential flow structures in the model geometry and a real nasal cavity shows the relevance of the model data. The analysis of the steady and unsteady solutions indicate that at Reynolds numbers Re>=1500 the differences of the solutions of the unsteady and steady flow field can be neglegted. To be more precise, the comparison of the total pressure loss distribution as a function of mass flux for the steady state and unsteady solutions shows the major differences to occur at increasing mass flux. At transition from inspiration to expiration the unsteady results differ the most from the steady state solutions. At high mass fluxes the total pressure loss of the nasal cavity flow almost matches that of the steady state solutions. The comparison with rhinomanometry measurements confirms the present numerical findings.},

  Abstract                 = {The unsteady flow through a model of the human nasal cavity is analyzed at a S trouhal number of Sr = 0.791 for the complete respiration cycle. A comparison of the essential flow structures in the model geometry and a real nasal cavity shows the relevance of the model data. The analysis of the steady and unsteady solutions indicate that at R eynolds numbers Re â‰¥ 1500 the differences of the solutions of the unsteady and steady flow field can be neglegted. To be more precise, the comparison of the total pressure loss distribution as a function of mass flux for the steady state and unsteady solutions shows the major differences to occur at increasing mass flux. At transition from inspiration to expiration the unsteady results differ the most from the steady state solutions. At high mass fluxes the total pressure loss of the nasal cavity flow almost matches that of the steady state solutions. The comparison with rhinomanometry measurements confirms the present numerical findings.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle behavior in the human respiratory tract is well understood and can be used to (1) estimate particle deposition in all regions of the respiratory tract for any aerosol respired at any pattern, and (2) optimize targeting of all regions of the respiratory tract in respiratory drug delivery. Extrathoracic and alveolar regions can effectively be targeted with mono- and polydisperse aerosols respired steadily. Effective targeting of the bronchial region can only be achieved with bolus inhalations. When particles are suspended in a gas heavier than air, targeting the alveolar region can be enhanced.},

PedersenInstitute of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, University of Aarhus, Denmark.AbstractTo study the geometry of the nasal cavity we applied an acoustic method (J. Appl. Physiol. 43: 523â€“536, 1977) providing an estimate of cross-sectional area as a function of distance. Acoustic areas in a model constructed from a human nasal cast, in the nasal cavity of a cadaver and in 10 normal subjects and two patients with well-defined afflictions of the nasal cavity, were compared with similar areas obtained by computerized tomography (CT) scans, a specially developed water displacement method, and anterior rhinomanometry. We found a coefficient of variation of the areas of less than 2% by the acoustic method compared with 15% for the rhinomanometric measurements. Acoustic areas correlated highly to similar areas obtained by CT scanning (r = 0.94) and by water displacement (r = 0.96). In two patients the acoustic method accurately outlined, respectively, a tumor in the nose and a septum deviation. It is concluded that this method provides an accurate method for measuring the geometry of the nasal cavity. It is easy to perform and is potentially useful for investigation of physiological and pathological changes in the nose. Copyright Â© 1989 the American Physiological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Particle deposition in the human respiratory tract is determined by biological factors such as lung morphology and breathing patterns, and physical factors such as fluid dynamics, particle properties, and deposition mechanisms. Current particle deposition models may be grouped into two categories referring to the region of interest in the lung, i.e. either deposition in the whole lung (whole lung models), or deposition in a localized region of the lung (local scale models). In whole lung models, particle deposition in individual airways is computed by analytical equations for particle deposition efficiencies and specific flow conditions (analytical models). The present review focuses upon the philosophy of different conceptual whole lung models to determine deposition in bronchial and acinar airway generations, and to compare the deposition patterns predicted by these models. Since any modeling approach requires validation by comparison with the available experimental evidence, predicted deposition data are compared with published experimental data in human subjects. This comparison indicates that, at least during the writing of this review, deposition models can be validated only for total and, to some extent, for regional deposition. In local scale models, particle transport and deposition equations are solved by Computational Fluid and Particle Dynamics (CFPD) methods (numerical models), providing information on particle deposition patterns within selected structural elements of the lung, e.g. bronchial bifurcations. In this review, however, only their potential contribution to improve upon current analytical whole lung models will be considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate prediction of ventilation flow is of primary importance for designing a healthy, comfortable, and energy-efficient indoor environment. Since the 1970s, the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has increased tremendously, and nowadays, it is one of the primary methods to assess ventilation flow in buildings. The most commonly used numerical approach consists of solving the steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with a turbulence model to provide closure. This article presents a detailed validation study of steady RANS for isothermal forced mixing ventilation of a cubical enclosure driven by a transitional wall jet. The validation is performed using particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements for slot Reynolds numbers of 1000 and 2500. Results obtained with the renormalization group (RNG) k-epsilon model, a low-Reynolds k-epsilon model, the shear stress transport (SST) k-omega model, and a Reynolds stress model (RSM) are compared with detailed experimental data. In general, the RNG k-epsilon model shows the weakest performance, whereas the low-Re k-epsilon model shows the best agreement with the measurements. In addition, the influence of the turbulence model on the predicted air exchange efficiency in the cubical enclosure is analyzed, indicating differences up to 44% for this particular case.},

  Abstract                 = {Nanoparticles are of wide interest due to their potential use for diverse commercial applications. Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals possessing unique optical and electrical properties. Although QDs are commonly made of cadmium, a metal known to have neurological effects, potential transport of QDs directly to the brain has not been assessed. This study evaluated whether QDs (CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals) could be transported from the olfactory tract to the brain via inhalation. Adult C57BL/6 mice were exposed to an aerosol of QDs for 1 h via nasal inhalation, and nanoparticles were detected 3 h post-exposure within the olfactory tract and olfactory bulb by a wide range of techniques, including visualisation via fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. We conclude that, following short-term inhalation of solid QD nanoparticles, there is rapid olfactory uptake and axonal transport to the brain/olfactory bulb with observed activation of microglial cells, indicating a pro-inflammatory response. To our knowledge, this is the first study to clearly demonstrate that QDs can be rapidly transported from the nose to the brain by olfactory uptake via axonal transport following inhalation.},

In the present work, transient airflow patterns and particle deposition during both inspiratory and expiratory processes were numerically simulated in the realistic human upper respiratory tract model with 14 cartilaginous rings (CRs) in the tracheal tube. The present model was validated under steady inspiratory flow rates by comparing current results with the theoretical models and published experimental data. The transient deposition fraction was found to strongly depend on breathing flow rate and particle diameter but slightly on turbulence intensity. Particles were mainly distributed in the high axial speed zones and traveled basically following the secondary flow. "Hot spots" of deposition were found in the lower portion of mouth cavity and posterior wall of pharynx/larynx during inspiration, but transferred to upper portion of mouth and interior wall of pharynx/larynx during expiration. The deposition fraction in the trachea during expiration was found to be much higher than that during inspiration because of the stronger secondary flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;All-night EEG recordings from 12 male apnea patients and 12 age-matched healthy control subjects were studied in the present work. The spectral mean frequency was used to provide computational sleep depth curves from two frontopolar and two central EEG channels. Our previously presented computational parameters quantifying the properties of the sleep depth curves were improved. The resulting light sleep percentage (LS%) values were higher in apnea patients than in control subjects in the right central brain position (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.028), in concordance to our previous work. Moreover, apnea patients showed higher LS% values in the right frontopolar position (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.008). Also, apnea patients showed a smaller anteroposterior sleep depth difference than control subjects on the right hemisphere (P&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.002). These are interesting new findings, achieved by the present methodology. Thus, the developed computational parameters were able to quantify, at least to some degree, the disruption of sleep process caused by the recurrent apneic events.},

  Abstract                 = {Effective management of asthma is dependent on achieving adequate delivery of the drugs into the lung. Inhalers come in the form of dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) with the former requiring a deep fast breath for activation while there are no restrictions on inhalation rates for the latter. This study investigates two aerosol medication delivery methods (i) an idealised case for drug particle delivery under a normal breathing cycle (inhalation-exhalation) and (ii) for an increased effort during the inhalation with a breath hold. A computational model of a human tracheobronchial airway was reconstructed from computerised tomography (CT) scans. The model's geometry and lobar flow distribution were compared with experimental and empirical models to verify the current model. Velocity contours and secondary flow vectors showed vortex formation downstream of the bifurcations which enhanced particle deposition. The velocity contour profiles served as a predictive tool for the final deposition patterns. Different spherical aerosol particle sizes (3-10Â [mu]m, 1.55Â g/cm3) were introduced into the airway for comparison over a range of Stokes number. It was found that a deep inhalation with a breath hold of 2Â s did not necessarily increase later deposition up to the sixth branch generation, but rather there was an increase in the deposition in the first few airway generations was found. In addition the breath hold allows deposition by sedimentation which assists in locally targeted deposition. Visualisation of particle deposition showed local "hot-spots" where particle deposition was concentrated in the lung airway.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a comparative study into the inhalation by the human respiratory system of airborne carbon and glass fibres released from burning composite materials used in aircraft. Using experimental data on the release of fibres from composites produced from fires, carbon and glass fibres of varying lengths were evaluated for their likely deposition in the human respiratory airway during inhalation. An anatomical model of the respiratory system coupled with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was used to analyse the fibre trajectories from the outside air, through the nostrils, and into the respiratory system (including the larynx, trachea and lungs). Deposition of carbon fibres were more influenced by their length than glass fibres, which is attributed to their lower density and smaller diameter. Local deposition fractions showed that all fibres either deposited mainly in the nasal cavity or penetrated through to the lungs.},

  Abstract                 = {Airflow analysis can assist in better understanding the physiology however the human nasal cavity is an extremely complicated geometry that is difficult to visualize in 3D space, let alone in 2D space. In this paper, an anatomically accurate 3D surface of the nasal passages derived from CT data was unwrapped and transformed into a 2D space, into a UV-domain (where u and v are the coordinates) to allow a complete view of the entire wrapped surface. This visualization technique allows surface flow parameters to be analyzed with greater precision. A UV-unwrapping tool is developed and a strategy is presented to allow deeper analysis to be performed. This includes (i) the ability to present instant comparisons of geometry and flow variables between any number of different nasal cavity models through normalization of the 2D unwrapped surface; (ii) visualization of an entire surface in one view and; (iii) a planar surface that allows direct 1D and 2D analytical solutions of diffusion of inhaled vapors and particles through the nasal walls. This work lays a foundation for future investigations that correlates adverse and therapeutic health responses to local inhalation of gases and particles.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle depositional studies from nasal sprays are important for efficient drug delivery. The main influences on deposition involve the nasal cavity geometry and the nasal spray device of which its parameters are controlled by the product design. It is known that larger particle sizes (? 10 ?m) at a flow rate of 333 ml/s impact in the anterior portion of the nose, leaving a significant portion of the nasal cavity unexposed to the drugs. Studies have found correlations for the spray cone angles and particle sizes with deposition efficiencies. This study extends these ideas to incorporate other parameters such as the insertion angle of the nasal spray and the injected particle velocity to observe its effect on deposition. A numerical method utilizing a particle tracking procedure found that the most important parameter was the particle's Stokes number which affected all other parameters on the deposition efficiency.},

Results The inspiratory flow passes through a wider olfactory area than the expiratory flow, and the sniffing flow passes through the widest olfactory area without increasing the velocity of the airflow. In addition, a recirculating flow strongly promotes olfactory function.

A population-based cross-sectional study with a random sample of 1016 adults, 21â€“63 years old, living in Pirkanmaa District in South Finland was conducted. This study focused on 342 office workers classified as professionals, clerks or administrative personnel according to their current occupation by the International Standard Classification of Occupations-88. They answered a questionnaire about personal information, health, smoking, occupation, and exposures in the work environment and at home. In logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, sex and a set of other confounders, all three exposures were related to a significantly increased risk of general symptoms (headache and fatigue). Exposure to paper dust and to FPP was associated with upper respiratory and skin symptoms, breathlessness, tonsillitis and middle ear infections. Exposure to CCP increased the risk of eye symptoms, chronic bronchitis and breathlessness. It was also associated with increased occurrence of sinus and middle ear infections and diarrhoea. A doseâ€“response relations was observed between the number of exposures and occurrence of headache. The risk of tonsillitis and sinus infections also increased with increasing number of exposures. All chronic respiratory symptoms, apart from cough, were increased in the highest exposure category (including all three exposures). This study provides new evidence that exposure to paper dust and to FPP is related to the risk of SBS symptoms, breathlessness and upper respiratory infections. It strengthens the evidence that exposure to CCP increases the risk of eye symptoms, general symptoms, chronic respiratory symptoms and some respiratory infections. Reduction of these exposures could improve the health of office workers.},

The hygrometer can easily obtain five to six measurements per second with an uncertainty of less than 0.3 K. The meter range is between âˆ’10 Â°C and 40 Â°C dew point. In the second part of the paper (section 2), two different successful applications in medicine based on fast humidity measurements have been discussed.

  Abstract                 = {Blood flow in arteries is characterized by pulse pressure waves due to the interaction with the vessel walls. A 3D fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model in a compliant vessel is used to represent the pressure wave propagation. The 3D fluid is described through a shear-thinning generalized Newtonian model and the structure by a nonlinear hyperelastic model. In order to cope with the spurious reflections due to the truncation of the computational domain, several absorbing boundary conditions are analyzed. First, a 1D hyperbolic model that effectively captures the wave propagation nature of blood flow in arteries is coupled with the 3D FSI model. Extending previous results, an energy estimate is derived for the 3D FSI-1D coupling in the case of generalized Newtonian models. Secondly, absorbing boundary conditions obtained from the 1D model are imposed directly on the outflow sections of the 3D FSI model, and numerical results comparing the different absorbing conditions in an idealized vessel are presented. Results in a human carotid bifurcation reconstructed from medical images are also provided in order to show that the proposed methodology can be applied to anatomically realistic geometries.},

To test the validity of the fluid phase simulations, PIV measurements were carried out in a central sagittal plane of an identical model cast. Velocity and kinetic-energy profiles showed good quantitative agreement of experiments with LES/DES, and less so with RANS k-[omega]. Mouth-throat deposition was simulated for particle diameters 2, 4, 6, 8 and . By comparison with existing experimental data, LES/DES showed considerable improvement over the RANS k-[omega] model in predicting deposition for particle sizes below . For the bigger particles, RANS k-[omega] and LES/DES methods produced similarly good predictions. It is concluded that for the simulation of medication aerosols inhaled at a steady flow rate of 30Â l/min, LES and DES provide more accurate results than the RANS k-[omega] model tested.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate prediction of nanoparticle (1-100Â nm) deposition in the rat nasal cavity is important for assessing the toxicological impact of inhaled nanoparticles as well as for potential therapeutic applications. A quasi-steady assumption has been widely adopted in the past investigations on this topic, yet the validity of such simplification under various breathing and sniffing conditions has not been carefully examined. In this study, both steady and unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted in a published rat nasal model under various physiologically realistic breathing and sniffing flow rates. The transient airflow structures, nanoparticle transport and deposition patterns in the whole nasal cavity and the olfactory region were investigated and compared with steady state simulation of equivalent flow rate. The results showed that (1) the quasi-steady flow assumption for cyclic flow was valid for over 70% of the cycle period during all simulated breathing and sniffing conditions in the rat nasal cavity, or the unsteady effect was only significant during the transition between the respiratory phases; (2) yet the quasi-steady assumption for nanoparticle transport was not valid, except in the vicinity of peak respiration. In general, the total deposition efficiency of nanoparticle during cyclic breathing would be lower than that of steady state due to the unsteady effect on particle transport and deposition, and further decreased with the increase of particle size, sniffing frequency, and flow rate. In the contrary, previous study indicated that for micro-scale particles (0.5-4Â [mu]m), the unsteady effect would increase deposition efficiencies in rat nasal cavity. Combined, these results suggest that the quasi-steady assumption of nasal particle transport during cycling breathing should be used with caution for an accurate assessment of the toxicological and therapeutic impact of particle inhalation. Empirical equations and effective steady state approximation derived in this study are thus valuable to estimate such unsteady effects in future applications. Finally, through large eddy simulations, turbulent effects were found to be negligible for all breathing/sniff conditions in rat nasal cavity.},

A large eddy simulation (LES) based on this model investigated the deposition of inhaled particles within the human URT. Steady respiration mode was first considered with three kinds of breathing intensity Q=30, 60 and 90Â L/min and then compared with an unsteady respiration mode at the breathing intensity of . The deposition efficiencies (DEs) of different particles with density of [rho]=600, and particle diameter of d=1, 5, was studied, respectively. The results showed that the increases of particle diameter, particle density and breathing intensity improves the particle DEs in the human URT; and the particle DEs in unsteady respiration mode are higher than those in steady mode. The results agree well with corresponding experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {In the case of substances with a limited toxicological data base there is often (i) a lack of qualified human toxicological data; and (ii) a paucity of studies with adequate exposure duration. Hence, several extrapolations have to be performed to arrive at appropriate risk assessments or derive occupational exposure limits. The present paper deals with the possibilities for extrapolating the change in effect concentrations over time (time extrapolation, e.g. from subacute to chronic exposure) and for interspecies extrapolation (from animal to human) in connection with locally acting substances (respiratory toxicants). To justify the time extrapolation factors, 46 technical reports produced by the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) involving studies with subacute, subchronic and chronic exposure duration were evaluated. On the basis of geometric mean values, decreases in effect concentrations by factors of 3.2 (subacute â†’ subchronic), 2.7 (subchronic â†’ chronic) and 6.6 (subacute â†’ chronic) were found. Differentiation according to animal species (mouse, rat), sex or substance properties did not result in any relevant changes of the mean value. NTP studies with less than lifetime exposure periods (subacute, subchronic) in many cases showed different locations of respiratory effects compared with chronic studies, and thus offered limited possibilities for qualitative prediction of long-term respiratory effects (occurrence of effects in certain regions of the respiratory tract). With regard to interspecies extrapolation, gaseous and particulate substances were evaluated separately. With some modifications (e.g. consideration of the clearance of particles of low solubility), the 1994 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) model for deriving reference concentrations for humans on the basis of experimental data in animals is proposed for inhalable particulate substances. In the case of gaseous substances, the assumptions of the EPA model do not seem to consider sufficiently the local inhomogeneity in substance distribution and anatomical and histological differences between the upper respiratory tracts of rodents and humans. Considerable uncertainty would attach to a default factor for interspecies extrapolation for gaseous substances.},

  Abstract                 = {Background. Skeletal nasal changes in elderly people have been extensively investigated, but data on variation of the endonasal architecture with age do not exist. We evaluated endonasal parameters in an elderly population as computed with those in a young group. Methods. Acoustic rhinometry measurements were performed on 165 participants in the age range of 20-93 years, The rhinograms provided the endonasal volume from the nostril entrance to a 7.0 cm cephalic point (VO-7) and the minimal cross-sectional areas (MCA1 and MCA2). Statistical analysis was performed by Pearson correlation and one-way analysis of variance, using age as a continuous or categorical variable. Results. There was no statistical difference in gender distribution within each age group. The results obtained for the left and fight nostrils were similar. Endonasal volume VO-7 and the narrowing areas MCA1 anti MCA2 significantly increase with age, except for men over 80 years in which a relative decrease was observed, Conclusion. Acoustic rhinometry examination of the endonasal architecture in a healthy Young and elderly population demonstrated a gradual increase of endonasal volumes and minimal cross-sectional areas with age,},

  Abstract                 = {Skeletal nasal changes in elderly people have been extensively investigated, but data on variation of the endonasal architecture with age do not exist. We evaluated endonasal parameters in an elderly population as compared with those in a young group. Acoustic rhinometry measurements were performed on 165 participants in the age range of 20-93 years. The rhinograms provided the endonasal volume from the nostril entrance to a 7.0 cm cephalic point (V0-7) and the minimal cross-sectional areas (MCA1 and MCA2). Statistical analysis was performed by Pearson correlation and one-way analysis of variance, using age as a continuous or categorical variable. There was no statistical difference in gender distribution within each age group. The results obtained for the left and right nostrils were similar. Endonasal volume V0-7 and the narrowing areas MCA1 and MCA2 significantly increase with age, except for men over 80 years in which a relative decrease was observed. Acoustic rhinometry examination of the endonasal architecture in a healthy young and elderly population demonstrated a gradual increase of endonasal volumes and minimal cross-sectional areas with age.},

Flow equations were numerically solved for the steady inspiratory condition with the tube length, the branching angle and flow velocity being varied over a wide range. In general, the [Delta]P coefficient K showed a power-law dependence on Reynolds number (Re) and length-to-diameter ratio with a different exponent for Re>=100 than for Re<100. The effect of different branching angles on pressure loss was very weak in the smooth-branching airways.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, a direct-forcing immersed boundary method (IBM) for thermal lattice Boltzmann method (TLBM) is proposed to simulate the non-isothermal flows. The direct-forcing IBM formulas for thermal equations are derived based on two TLBM models: a double-population model with a simplified thermal lattice Boltzmann equation (Model 1) and a hybrid model with an advection-diffusion equation of temperature (Model 2). As an interface scheme, which is required due to a mismatch between boundary and computational grids in the IBM, the sharp interface scheme based on second-order bilinear and linear interpolations (instead of the diffuse interface scheme, which uses discrete delta functions) is adopted to obtain the more accurate results. The proposed methods are validated through convective heat transfer problems with not only stationary but also moving boundaries - the natural convection in a square cavity with an eccentrically located cylinder and a cold particle sedimentation in an infinite channel. In terms of accuracy, the results from the IBM based on both models are comparable and show a good agreement with those from other numerical methods. In contrast, the IBM based on Model 2 is more numerically efficient than the IBM based on Model 1.},

In the present work, the effects of heterogeneous airway obstructions on the distribution of air and helium-oxygen were examined using an in vitro model, the two compartments of a dual adult test lung. Breathing helium-oxygen resulted in a consistently more uniform distribution, with the gas volume delivered to a severely obstructed compartment increased by almost 80%. An engineering approach to pipe flow was used to analyze the test lung and was extrapolated to a human lung model to show that the in vitro experimental parameters are relevant to the observed in vivo conditions. The engineering analysis also showed that helium-oxygen can decrease the relative weight of the flow resistance due to obstructions if they are inertial in nature (i.e., density dependent) due to either turbulence or laminar convective losses.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a review of nasal-air conditioning, a process essential to undisturbed gas exchange and cleansing of the respiratory mucosa in the nose. A selective literature review was made on the basis of in vivo measurements and computer simulation of the upper airways as well as the authors' own clinical and experimental data. Healthy subjects normally breathe through the nose, although the nasal airways have significantly higher airway resistance compared to the oral cavity, which is opened for breathing during exercise, in the case of nasal airway blockage, or in allergic rhinitis. In addition to olfaction, the main tasks of nasal breathing include: cleansing, defense, and conditioning (i.e., humidification and heating). The current knowledge of nasal conditioning processes will be discussed. In addition, research activities of particular relevance for diagnosis and intervention in various pathologies of the upper airways will be presented.},

We addressed this question by examining restrained eaters' brain response to food (chocolate) and non-food (geraniol, floral) odors, both when odor was attended to and when ignored. Using olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs), we found that restrained eaters and controls responded similarly to the non-food odor; however, unlike controls, restrained eaters showed no increase in brain response to the food odor when they focused attention on it. Rather, restrained eaters showed attenuated OERP amplitudes to the food odor in both attended and ignored conditions, suggesting that the brain's response to attended food odor was abnormally suppressed.},

  Abstract                 = {The transport and uptake of inspired odorant molecules in the human nasal cavity were determined using an anatomically correct three-dimensional finite element model. The steady-state equations of motion and continuity were first solved to determine laminar flow patterns of odorous air at quiet breathing flow rates. The air stream entering the ventral tip of the naris travelled to the olfactory slit, and then passed through the slit in nearly a straight path without forming separated recirculating zones. The fraction of volumetric flow passing through the olfactory airway was about 10%, and remained nearly constant with variations in flow rate. The three-dimensional inspiratory velocity field was used in the solution of the uncoupled steady convective-diffusion equation to determine the concentration field in the airways and odorant mass flux at the nasal walls. The mass-transfer boundary condition used at the nasal cavity wall included the effects of solubility and diffusivity of odorants in the mucosal lining, and the thickness of the mucus layer. The total olfactory flux of odorants, that is highly correlated with perceived odor intensity, was determined as a function of all transport parameters in our model. Increase in nasal flow rate at a constant inlet concentration resulted in an increase in total olfactory uptake for all odorants. However, with increase in flow rate, the fractional uptake, i.e., total olfactory flux normalized by convective flux at the inlet, decreased for poorly soluble odorants, while it increased for highly soluble odorants. The pattern of flux (or imposed patterning) across the olfactory mucosa, that carries information concerning odor identity, was also determined as a function of transport parameters. There was an overall decrease in odorant flux as the location on the olfactory surface was varied from the anterior towards the posterior and from the inferior towards the superior ends. The flux pattern became more uniform, i.e., the steepness of the flux gradients across the olfactory surface decreased, as the mucus solubility of the odorants decreased. Different odorants generated discernibly different flux patterns across the olfactory mucosa that may contribute to the encoding of odor quality. Variation of total olfactory flux with time after cessation of airflow was determined by solving the unsteady diffusion equation in the air-phase. The flux decreased approximately exponentially with time. The rate of decay decreased as solubility and diffusivity decreased, but was very rapid over a wide range of the parameters, with time constants of less that 0.5 s for most odorants, implying a rapid decrease in perceived odor intensity with cessation of nasal airflow.},

  Abstract                 = {Cardiovascular disorders are common in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) but there is debate as to whether OSAS is an independent risk factor for their development, since OSAS may be associated with other disorders and risk factors that predispose to cardiovascular disease. In an effort to quantify the risk of OSAS patients for cardiovascular disease arising from these other factors, the authors assessed the future risk for cardiovascular disease among a group of 114 consecutive patients with established OSAS prior to nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy, using an established method of risk prediction employed in the Framingham studies. Patients were 100 males, aged (mean+/-SD) 52+/-9.0 yrs, and 14 females, aged 51+/-10.4 yrs, with an apnoea/hypopnoea index of 45+/-22 x h(-1). Based on either a prior diagnosis, or a mean of three resting blood pressure recordings >140 mmHg systolic and/or 90 diastolic, 68% of patients were hypertensive. Only 18% were current smokers, while 16% had either diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance, and 63% had elevated fasting cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels. The estimated 10-yr risk of a coronary heart disease (CHD) event in males was (mean+/-SEM) 13.9+/-0.9%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 12.1-16.0, and for a stroke was 12.3+/-1.4%; 95% CI 9.4-15.1, with a combined 10 yr risk for stroke and CHD events of 32.9+/-2.7%; 95% CI 27.8-38.5 in males aged >53 yrs. These findings indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients are at high risk of future cardiovascular disease from factors other than obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, and may help explain the difficulties in identifying a potential independent risk from obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.},

During breathing, the main laminar flow stream passes through the middle meatus and turbulent flow can be detected under physiologic conditions. <i>Objectives</i>. Physical models or casts of the nasal cavity have been utilized in several studies in an effort to understand its aerodynamics. PIV is a new technique for measuring the aerodynamic properties of tubular structures. In this article we evaluate nasal airflow characteristics during physiologic breathing under normal conditions and the usefulness of PIV. <i>Material and methods</i>. A nasal model cast obtained by a combination of rapid prototyping and solidification of clear silicone was connected to a pump which simulated the physiological pressure in the upper airway system. A glycerolÃ¢â‚¬â€œwater mixture was used as the flow material. The airstream was marked with spherical polyvinyl particles, observed through solidified clear silicone and analyzed using PIV. <i>Results</i>. The main flow within the cavity, which was mostly laminar, passed through the middle meatus. Turbulence was clearly visible in the anteroinferior part of the middle turbinate. The flow rate was highest at the middle meatus during inspiration and expiration.},

  Abstract                 = {Mucociliary clearance is a major function of the airway epithelium. This important function depends both on the physicochemical properties of the airway mucus and on the activity of the cilia. The former, in turn, is dependent mainly on the quality and quantity of mucous glycoproteins or mucins, which are produced by two different cell types, namely, goblet cells of the epithelium and mucous cells of the submucosal gland. Neither the structural nor the functional differences of mucins produced by these two cell types are yet known. The availability of primary airway epithelial cell culture systems, however, has made it possible to study the structure and regulation of airway goblet cells to some extent. The epithelial mucins are extremely hydrophobic and are associated with various macromolecules, the quality and quantity of which may also affect the physicochemical properties of the mucus. Secretion of epithelial mucins is stimulated by various factors, including a number of inflammatory agents. The recent progress in mucin molecular biological research will allow us to identify different mucin core proteins produced by those different cell types, and, hopefully, the differential functions of these mucins in health and disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Respiratory physiology and pathology are strongly dependent on the airflow inside the nasal cavity. However, the nasal anatomy, which is characterized by complex airway channels and significant individual differences, is difficult to analyze. Thus, commonly adopted diagnostic tools have yielded limited success. Nevertheless, with the rapid advances in computer resources, there have been more elaborate attempts to correlate airflow characteristics in human nasal airways with the symptoms and functions of the nose by computational fluid dynamics study. Furthermore, the computed nasal geometry can be virtually modified to reflect predicted results of the proposed surgical technique. In this article, several computational fluid mechanics (CFD) issues on patient-specific three dimensional (3D) modeling of nasal cavity and clinical applications were reviewed in relation to the cases of deviated nasal septum (decision for surgery), turbinectomy, and maxillary sinus ventilation (simulated- and post-surgery). Clinical relevance of fluid mechanical parameters, such as nasal resistance, flow allocation, wall shear stress, heat/humidity/NO gas distributions, to the symptoms and surgical outcome were discussed. Absolute values of such parameters reported by many research groups were different each other due to individual difference of nasal anatomy, the methodology for 3D modeling and numerical grid, laminar/turbulent flow model in CFD code. But, the correlation of these parameters to symptoms and surgery outcome seems to be obvious in each research group with subject-specific models and its variations (virtual- and post-surgery models). For the more reliable, patient-specific, and objective tools for diagnosis and outcomes of nasal surgery by using CFD, the future challenges will be the standardizations on the methodology for creating 3D airway models and the CFD procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {The anatomical structure of the nasal passages differs significantly among species, affecting airflow and the transport of inhaled gases and particles throughout the respiratory tract. Since direct measurement of local nasal dose is often difficult, 3-dimensional, anatomically accurate, computational models of the rat, monkey, and human nasal passages were developed to estimate regional transport and dosimetry of inhaled material. The computational models predicted that during resting breathing, a larger portion of inspired air passed through olfactory-lined regions in the rat than in the monkey or human. The models also predicted that maximum wall mass flux (mass per surface area per time) of inhaled formaldehyde in the nonsquamous epithelium was highest in monkeys (anterior middle turbinate) and similar in rats and humans (dorsal medial meatus in the rat and mid-septum in the human, near the squamous/nonsquamous epithelial boundary in both species). For particles that are 5 {micro}m in aerodynamic diameter, preliminary simulations at minute volume flow rates predicted nasal deposition efficiencies of 92%, 11% and 25% in the rat, monkey, and human, respectively, with more vestibular deposition in the rat than in the monkey or human. Estimates such as these can be used to test hypotheses about mechanisms of toxicity and supply species-specific information for risk assessment, thus reducing uncertainty in extrapolating animal data to humans.},

In particular, we propose a mechanism for the formation of the streamers observed in the experiment. We also discuss the performance of the numerical models for flows of this type.},

  Abstract                 = {Airflows in the nasal cavities and oral airways are rather complex, possibly featuring a transition to turbulent jet-like flow, recirculating flow, Deans flow, vortical flows, large pressure drops, prevailing secondary flows, and merging streams in the case of exhalation. Such complex flows propagate subsequendy into the tracheobronchial airways. The underlying assumptions for particle transport and deposition are that the aerosols are spherical, noninteracting, and monodisperse and deposit upon contact with the airway surface. Such dilute particle suspensions are typically modeled with the Euler-Lagrange approach for micron particles and in the Euler-Euler framework for nanoparticles. Micron particles deposit nonuniformly with very high concentrations at some local sites (e.g., carinal ridges of large bronchial airways). In contrast, nanomaterial almost coats the airway surfaces, which has implications of detrimental health effects in the case of inhaled toxic nanoparticles. Geometric airway features, as well as histories of airflow fields and particle distributions, may significantly affect particle deposition.},

  Abstract                 = {Nasal delivery is considered for an increasing number of existing and new drugs and vaccines, but current nasal delivery devices have major disadvantages. The Norwegian company OptiNose AS is developing a novel concept that challenges traditional delivery systems. The patended bi-directional delivery system improves drug and vaccine distribution to the nasal mucous membrane while at the same time preventing lung deposition. It takes advantage of the posterior connection between the nasal passages persisting when the velum automatically closes during oral exhalation. It is the exhalation into the delivery device that triggers the release of particles into an airflow, which enters one nostril via a sealing nozzle and exits through the other nostril.This paper describes how OptiNose is using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) during the development process for their drug delivery concept. The simulations are used to visualize and demonstrate the basic features of the bi-directional technique and discuss how its design and function could be further optimized. CFD computations thus increase the efficiency of device development and reduce the need for expensive and time consuming laboratory experiments. To perform successful CFD calculations on the nose, construction of a proper surface grid of the nasal cavity is important. The process of building the surface grid is presented in the paper. The final surface grid was next imported into Tgrid, a volume grid generator, and finally the simulations were carried out by use of the commercial CFD code FLUENT. These steps are described in the paper. Testing of the cell quality, both during surface grid and volume grid generation, is mandatory. The testing procedures are briefly presented in the paper. Finally, to be able to rely on the CFD computations done, one needs thorough validation. This article presents some comparison of the CFD computation results against physical experiments. The comparison analysis shows promising results.},

Extensive literature demonstrates that aging is accompanied by olfactory loss and hyposmia/anosmia which is also a feature of several neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are characterized by severe olfactory deficits, while problems of olfactory discrimination are less prominent features in several other disorders. Olfactory loss is accompanied by structural abnormalities of the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb and the central olfactory cortices. This review summarizes our present knowledge about the pathological changes in the olfactory system during aging and in various neurodegenerative diseases. },

  Abstract                 = {The deformation of an initially spherical capsule, freely suspended in simple shear flow, can be computed analytically in the limit of small deformations [D. BarthÃ©s-Biesel, J.M. Rallison, The time-dependent deformation of a capsule freely suspended in a linear shear flow, J. Fluid Mech. 113 (1981) 251-267]. Those analytic approximations are used to study the influence of the mesh tessellation method, the spatial resolution, and the discrete delta function of the immersed boundary method on the numerical results obtained by a coupled immersed boundary lattice Boltzmann finite element method. For the description of the capsule membrane, a finite element method and the Skalak constitutive model [R. Skalak, A. Tozeren, R.P. Zarda, S. Chien, Strain energy function of red blood cell membranes, Biophys. J. 13 (1973) 245-264] have been employed. Our primary goal is the investigation of the presented model for small resolutions to provide a sound basis for efficient but accurate simulations of multiple deformable particles immersed in a fluid. We come to the conclusion that details of the membrane mesh, as tessellation method and resolution, play only a minor role. The hydrodynamic resolution, i.e.,Â the width of the discrete delta function, can significantly influence the accuracy of the simulations. The discretization of the delta function introduces an artificial length scale, which effectively changes the radius and the deformability of the capsule. We discuss possibilities of reducing the computing time of simulations of deformable objects immersed in a fluid while maintaining high accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To systematically evaluate the effect of formulation- and administration-related variables on nasal spray deposition using a nasal cast. METHODS: Deposition pattern was assessed by uniformly coating a transparent nose model with Sar-Gel(R), which changes from white to purple on contact with water. Sprays were subsequently discharged into the cast, which was then digitally photographed. Images were quantified using Adobe(R) Photoshop. The effects of formulation viscosity (which influences droplet size), simulated administration techniques (head orientation, spray administration angle, spray nozzle insertion depth), spray pump design and metering volume on nasal deposition pattern were investigated. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the deposition area associated with sprays of increasing viscosity. This appeared to be mediated by an increase in droplet size and a narrowing of the spray plume. Administration techniques and nasal spray pump design also had a significant effect on the deposition pattern. CONCLUSIONS: This simple color-based method provides quantitative estimates of the effects that different formulation and administration variables may have on the nasal deposition area, and provides a rational basis on which manufacturers of nasal sprays can base their patient instructions or post approval changes when it is impractical to optimize these using a clinical study.},

  Abstract                 = {Catalyst nanoparticles play an important role in the synthesis of carbon nanotubes. In this paper, we present a two-equation model that can predict the formation process of iron nanoparticles from ferrocene fed into a CVD reactor. The model, combined with an axisymmetric two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, includes the mechanism of nucleation and surface growth of an iron particle and bi-particle collision. The model predicts that the diameter of a particle will increase with an increase in the reaction temperature or the radial distance from the center of the reactor. Iron particles may deposit on the reactor wall; our model predicts that the thickness of the layer consisting of deposited iron particles will decrease with an increase in the axial distance from the entrance. The first prediction was validated by experimental observations reported by other researchers. In addition to the CFD simulation, a dimensional analysis was conducted to find pi-numbers that govern the process of particle formation; three pi-numbers were identified. Furthermore, one-dimensional governing equations were obtained under the assumptions of constant diffusion coefficient and collision frequency function, and solutions for particle diameter were obtained in qualitative agreement with the earlier CFD simulations.},

Time series of meteorological conditions as wind speed, wind direction and source strength were determined from the experimentally measured data and used as the inflow boundary conditions. Furthermore, for more realistic simulation of air flow in the computation domain for the desired atmospheric stability, periodic boundary conditions were used on both side boundaries. The initial two-phase flow of the released ammonia was also included. The liquid phase was modeled as droplets using discrete particle modeling, i.e. the Euler-Lagrangian approach for continuous and discrete phases.},

  Abstract                 = {Better understanding of aerosol dynamics is an important step for improving personal exposure assessments in indoor environments. Although the limitation of the assumptions in a well-mixed model is well known, there has been very little research reported in the published literature on the discrepancy of exposure assessments between numerical models which take account of gravitational effects and the well-mixed model. A new Eulerian-type drift-flux model has been developed to simulate particle dispersion and personal exposure in a two-zone geometry, which accounts for the drift velocity resulting from gravitational settling and diffusion. To validate the numerical model, a small-scale chamber was fabricated. The airflow characteristics and particle concentrations were measured by a phase Doppler Anemometer. Both simulated airflow and concentration profiles agree well with the experimental results. A strong inhomogeneous concentration was observed experimentally for 10Â [mu]m aerosols. The computational model was further applied to study a simple hypothetical, yet more realistic scenario. The aim was to explore different levels of exposure predicted by the new model and the well-mixed model. Aerosols are initially uniformly distributed in one zone and subsequently transported and dispersed to an adjacent zone through an opening. Owing to the significant difference in the rates of transport and dispersion between aerosols and gases, inferred from the results, the well-mixed model tends to overpredict the concentration in the source zone, and under-predict the concentration in the exposed zone. The results are very useful to illustrate that the well-mixed assumption must be applied cautiously for exposure assessments as such an ideal condition may not be applied for coarse particles.},

Most foreign particulates, including conventional particle-based drug delivery systems, are efficiently trapped in human mucus layers by steric obstruction and/or adhesion. Trapped particles are typically removed from the mucosal tissue within seconds to a few hours depending on anatomical location, thereby strongly limiting the duration of sustained drug delivery locally. A number of debilitating diseases could be treated more effectively and with fewer side effects if drugs and genes could be more efficiently delivered to the underlying mucosal tissues in a controlled manner. This review first describes the tenacious mucus barrier properties that have precluded the efficient penetration of therapeutic particles. It then reviews the design and development of new mucus-penetrating particles that may avoid rapid mucus clearance mechanisms, and thereby provide targeted or sustained drug delivery for localized therapies in mucosal tissues.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for the simulation of plasma materials interactions is presented. The method is based on the particle in cell technique for the description of the plasma and on the immersed boundary method for the description of the interactions between materials and plasma particles. A technique to adapt the local number of particles and grid adaptation are used to reduce the truncation error and the noise of the simulations, to increase the accuracy per unit cost. In the present work, the computational method is verified against known results. Finally, the simulation method is applied to a number of specific examples of practical scientific and engineering interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Modelling and simulation of heart valves is a challenging biomechanical problem due to anatomical variability, pulsatile physiological pressure loads and 3D anisotropic material behaviour. Current valvular models based on the finite element method can be divided into: those that do model the interaction between the blood and the valve (fluid-structure interaction or [`]wet' models) and those that do not (structural models or [`]dry' models). Here an anatomically sized model of the mitral valve has been used to compare the difference between structural and fluid-structure interaction techniques in two separately simulated scenarios: valve closure and a cardiac cycle. Using fluid-structure interaction, the valve has been modelled separately in a straight tubular volume and in a U-shaped ventricular volume, in order to analyse the difference in the coupled fluid and structural dynamics between the two geometries. The results of the structural and fluid-structure interaction models have shown that the stress distribution in the closure simulation is similar in all the models, but the magnitude and closed configuration differ. In the cardiac cycle simulation significant differences in the valvular dynamics were found between the structural and fluid-structure interaction models due to difference in applied pressure loads. Comparison of the fluid domains of the fluid-structure interaction models have shown that the ventricular geometry generates slower fluid velocity with increased vorticity compared to the tubular geometry. In conclusion, structural heart valve models are suitable for simulation of static configurations (opened or closed valves), but in order to simulate full dynamic behaviour fluid-structure interaction models are required.},

This model has been shown to perform very well on many challenging test cases such as separated, impinging and bluff-body flows, and including heat transfer. However, numerical convergence of the original model suggested by Durbin is quite difficult due to the boundary conditions requiring a coupling of variables at walls. A â€˜code-friendlyâ€™ version of the model was suggested by Lien and Durbin (Lien, F.S. and Durbin, P.A., Non linear Îº âˆ’ Îµ âˆ’ ?… 2 modelling with application to high-lift. In: Proceedings of the Summer Program 1996, Stanford University (1996), pp. 5â€“22) which removes the need of this coupling to allow a segregated numerical procedure, but with somewhat less accurate predictions. A robust modification of the model is developed to obtain homogeneous boundary conditions at a wall for both $$\bar v^2 $$ and f. The modification is based on both a change of variables and alteration of the governing equations. The new version is tested on a channel, a diffuser flow and flow over periodic hills and shown to reproduce the better results of the original model, while retaining the easier convergence properties of the â€˜code-friendlyâ€™ version.},

In order to get a deep understanding of the NP-cell interactions, scientists have focused on the physicochemical effects. However, there are still considerable debates about the regulation of nanomaterials and the reported results are usually in contradictions. Here, we are going to introduce the potential key reasons for these conflicts. In this case, modification of conventional <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicity assays, is one of the crucial ignored matter in nanotoxicological sciences. More specifically, the conventional methods neglect important factors such as the sedimentation of NPs and absorption of proteins and other essential biomolecules onto the surface of NPs. Another ignored matter in nanotoxicological sciences is the effect of cell â€œvisionâ€� (i.e., cell type). In order to show the effects of these ignored subjects, we probed the effect of superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs), with various surface chemistries, on various cell lines. We found thatthe modification of conventional toxicity assays and the consideration of the â€œcell visionâ€� concept are crucial matters to obtain reliable, and reproducible nanotoxicology data. These new concepts offer a suitable way to obtain a deep understanding on the cell-NP interactions. In addition, by consideration of these ignored factors, the conflict of future toxicological reports would be significantly decreased.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of lung volume reduction surgery on measured tracheal features. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Twenty-four male and 19 female patients with emphysema underwent lung volume reduction surgery, pulmonary function testing, and repeated CT. The tracheal air column was segmented from axial images. The sagittal and coronal dimensions of the intrathoracic trachea were determined. Tracheal morphology was quantified using the tracheal (coronal and sagittal dimensions) and circularity indexes. The results were compared with pulmonary function test results. RESULTS. Morphologic appearance of the intrathoracic trachea was consistent before and 3 months after surgery. The group means of the tracheal length, mean area, and volume were 78.60 mm ({+/-} 16.88 mm), 283.84 mm2 ({+/-} 61.47 mm2), and 22.59 cm3 ({+/-} 7.69 cm3), respectively, before surgery and 67.53 mm ({+/-} 15.78 mm), 309.12 mm2 ({+/-} 79.83 mm2), and 20.99 cm3 ({+/-} 7.27 cm3), respectively, after surgery (p < 0.05). Mean tracheal indexes were 0.85 ({+/-} 0.11) before surgery and 0.82 ({+/-} 0.04) after surgery (p < 0.01). Mean circularity indexes were 0.91 ({+/-} 0.03) before surgery and 0.90 ({+/-} 0.04) after surgery (p < 0.05). The size of the trachea was significantly correlated with lung volume before and after surgery (p < 0.05). The changes in tracheal features and changes in pulmonary function were not correlated (p > 0.05), except for tracheal area (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION. Our data suggest that tracheal dimensions reflect the severity of emphysema as reflected by increased lung volumes. Tracheal features were poor predictors of changes in postsurgical pulmonary function parameters evaluated in this preliminary study.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: Aerosol inhalation therapy is one of the methods to treat rhinosinusitis. However the topical drug delivery to the posterior nose and paranasal sinuses shows only limited efficiency. A precise sinusal targeting remains a main challenge for aerosol treatment of sinus disorders. This paper proposes a comparative study of the nasal deposition patterns of micron and submicron particles using planar gamma-scintigraphy imaging vs. a new 3-dimensional (3D) imaging approach based on SPECT-CT measurements. Methods: Radiolabelled nebulizations have been performed on a plastinated model of human nasal cast coupled with a respiratory pump. First, the benefits provided by SPECT-CT imaging were compared with 2D gamma-scintigraphy and radioactive quantification of maxillary sinus lavage as reference for the sonic 2.8 mu m aerosol sinusal deposition. Then, the impact on nasal deposition of various airborne particle sizes was assessed. Results: The 2D methodology overestimates aerosol deposition in the maxillary sinuses by a factor 9 whereas the 3D methodology is in agreement with the maxillary sinus lavage reference methodology. Then with the SPECT-CT approach we highlighted that the higher particle size was mainly deposited in the central nasal cavity contrary to the submicron aerosol particles (33.8 +/- 0.6% of total deposition for the 2.8 mu m particles vs. 1 +/- 0.3% for the 230 nm particles). Conclusion: Benefits of SPECT/CT for the assessment of radiolabelled aerosol deposition in rhinology are clearly demonstrated.

Unsteady Navier-Stokes equation and diffusion equation are solved by CFX-F3D, an FVM commercial code. Reynolds number based on the inlet conditions is varied between 0.533 and 24, and Womersley number between 0.0915 and 0.495, which correspond to the flow conditions in the 10th to the 18th generations of Weibel model at typical conditions of bolus experiments (tracheal breathing rate of 0.25 l/s, respiration period of 8 s and 0.8 [mu]m particle size). The dispersion characteristics during the inhalation period are seen the same as in steady inhalation, the total dispersion increasing monotonically with inhalation. When flow direction is reversed to exhalation, bolus dispersion decreases with exhalation at first, but comes to increase again at a rate almost equal to that for steady exhalation after a certain amount of exhalation. The maximum reduction of bolus dispersion after flow reversal is comparable to the increase of bolus dispersion in the last generation just before flow reversal.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently Lee and Balachandar proposed analytically-based expressions for drag and lift coefficients for a spherical particle moving on a flat wall in a linear shear flow at finite Reynolds number. In order to evaluate the accuracy of these expressions, we have conducted direct numerical simulations of a rolling particle for shear Reynolds number up to 100. We assume that the particle rolls on a horizontal flat wall with a small gap separating the particle from the wall (LÂ =Â 0.505) and thus avoiding the logarithmic singularity. The influence of the shear Reynolds number and the translational velocity of the particle on the hydrodynamic forces of the particle was investigated under both transient and the final drag-free and torque-free steady state. It is observed that the quasi-steady drag and lift expressions of Lee and Balachandar provide good approximation for the terminal state of the particle motion ranging from perfect sliding to perfect rolling. With regards to transient particle motion in a wall-bounded shear flow it is observed that the above validated quasi-steady drag and lift forces must be supplemented with appropriate wall-corrected added-mass and history forces in order to accurately predict the time-dependent approach to the terminal steady state. Quantitative comparison with the actual particle motion computed in the numerical simulations shows that the theoretical models quite effective in predicting rolling/sliding motion of a particle in a wall-bounded shear flow at moderate Re.},

  Abstract                 = {Urban turbulence characteristics are investigated at street canyon and neighbourhood scale. Three high resolution urban large-eddy simulation (LES) studies are performed using the urban version of the parallelized LES model PALM. Validation shows that the urban PALM version is in line with experimental and previous LES results, i.e. superior to the faster/cheaper conventional Reynolds-averaged (RANS) models. Two studies focus on quasi-2D urban street canyons driven by perpendicular flow. First is a parametric study of turbulence characteristics and flow dynamics within the canyon. The main results are: (1) Integral vertical turbulence profiles in deep canyons scale with canyon width. This is relevant for urban canopy parameterizations in larger-scale meteorological models. (2) A new concept of a "cavity shear layer" complements classical free shear layer concepts. (3) For the first time in urban LES Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are identified at the top of the urban street canyon. This is relevant for modelling urban dispersion, because the street canyon circulation is more intermittent than suggested by previous RANS results. Second, an Eulerian dispersion case study shows that differences in canyon flow dynamics are reflected in canyon dispersion characteristics compared to a previous RANS study. Third is a neighbourhood scale urban LES feasibility study: a passive tracer Lagrangian dispersion animation of Shinjuku, downtown Tokyo reveals turbulent flow features, upstream flow and intermittency. The main implications are always to use 3D models for turbulence simulations even in quasi-2D geometries, and not to underestimate the intermittency of turbulent flow. Standard deviations of velocity components within the canyon should not be treated as constant for perpendicular ambient wind but may be parameterized conveniently based on a vertical scaling with canyon width in deep canyons.},

  Abstract                 = {The control of cavity flows has been investigated by the means of Large Eddy Simulations. The computations have been carried out on unstructured meshes to assess the efficiency of two passive acoustic oscillation suppression devices: the rod-in-crossflow and the flat-top spoiler. Despite a sustained interest and many experiments, a clear explanation for observed reduction in the flow-induced structure load is still missing. This work explores different hypotheses: the modification of the mean field and its linear stability properties, a pure deflection effect of the separated shear layer, or scale coupling between the rod wake and the turbulent mixing layer over the cavity. The aim here is to enhance the experimental database and provide leads towards a better understanding of the phenomena. The selected test-case is a cavity of length/depth ratio equal to 5, at Mach and Reynolds number of M[infinity]=0.85 and ReL=7.106, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of sidewall boundary conditions on the computed unsteady flow and sound pressure level is investigated in a transonic open cavity. The hybrid approach used for modeling turbulence combines a Reynolds averaged mode in the boundary layer, and a large eddy simulation mode in the massively separated flow region within the cavity to resolve the wide dynamic range involved. Computational results are presented for the instantaneous vorticity and for the sound pressure level spectra. Comparison of the results obtained using inviscid and periodic sidewall boundary conditions show the sensitivity of the computed SPL spectra and autocorrelation to the conditions enforced at the sidewalls. The computed SPL spectra are also compared with available experimental results, with LES computational results, and with prior investigations based on the same hybrid turbulence model without the wall function used in the current investigation. The comparisons show that the current results obtained using inviscid sidewall boundary conditions are closest to the experimental sound pressure level spectra and that agreement is achieved at considerable saving in required computational resources.},

A finite-volume code and the SIMPLE scheme were used to solve the equations. The results show that the distribution of nanoparticle concentration is symmetrical with respect to the top and bottom sides of the tube. The diameter of the nanoparticles has a weak effect on the distribution of nanoparticle concentration. The maximum and minimum of the deposition enhancement factor occur near the outside and inside walls of the bend tube, respectively. The higher the Reynolds number is, the shorter is the time for nanoparticle deposition. The bend curvature radius has a slight effect on the deposition enhancement factor.},

  Abstract                 = {Objectives/Hypothesis: Elderly patients frequently complain about the feeling of a dry nose and recurrent crusting probably due to age-related degenerative effects of the nasal mucosa. Data on intranasal air conditioning in elderly patients are missing. The aim of the study was to compare intranasal heating and humidification of respiratory air in elderly subjects and a younger control group. Additionally, rhinomanometrical and rhinometrical data were examined. Study Design: The study was conceived as randomized, prospective study. Methods: Forty study subjects (median age, 70 years; range, 61-84) and 40 control subjects (median age, 27 years; range, 20-40) were included in the study. In vivo air temperature and humidity values were simultaneously measured at defined intranasal sites. Active anterior rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry also were performed in every subject. Results: In the study group, the median end-inspiratory air temperature (degrees C)/absolute humidity (g/m(3)) values were 24.0 degrees C/13.8 g/m(3) within the nasal valve region and 24.3 degrees C/14.7 g/m(3) anterior to the head of the middle turbinate. In the control group, the corresponding values were 27.0 degrees C/15.5 g/m(3) and 26.7 degrees C/17.0 g/m(3). Temperature and humidity values were significantly lower in the study group (P < .05). The minimal cross-sectional areas and volumes were significantly higher in the study group (P < .05). Conclusions: Nasal complaints in elderly patients are a consequence of lower intranasal air temperature and humidity values combined with relatively enlarged nasal cavities due to involution atrophy of the nasal mucosa.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes of nasal dimensions can influence the air-conditioning capacity of the nose because of alterations of airflow patterns. The goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation between intranasal temperature and humidity values and nasal dimensions, assessed by means of acoustic rhinometry. Eighty healthy volunteers (40 men and 40 women; median age, 51 years; range, 20-84 years) were enrolled in the study. In total, 160 nasal cavities were examined. All volunteers underwent a standardized acoustic rhinometry. Additionally, intranasal air temperature and humidity measurements at defined intranasal detection sites within the anterior nasal segment were performed. There was no statistically significant difference between the right and left side of the nose regarding air temperature, absolute humidity, and acoustic rhinometric values. A negative correlation was established between the rhinometric nasal volumes/minimal cross-sectional areas and air temperature and absolute humidity values at the three intranasal detection sites. According to our results, nasal volumes and cross- sectional areas relevantly influence nasal air conditioning. A healthy nasal cavity with smaller volumes and cross-sectional areas seems to present a more effective air-conditioning function than a too "wide" open nose because of changes in airflow patterns. This observation should be considered as a limitation for overly extensive nasal surgery especially of the turbinates.},

This study assesses if the age-related nasal changes are detectable with objective measurements and reflected in two validated quality of life outcome tools: the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation Scale (NOSE) and the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20) questionnaires. Methods Two study groups were included: the â€œyoungâ€� group A (n = 40) with a mean age of 27 years and the â€œelderâ€� group B (n = 40) with a mean age of 70 years. The subjective nasal complaints and quality of life status were recorded by means of the NOSE and SNOT-20 questionnaires. Objective assessment of intranasal dimensions and nasal airflow in all subjects were performed with the use of acoustic rhinometry and active anterior rhinomanometry respectively. Results The values obtained from acoustic rhinometry were significantly higher in the older group compared to the younger, presenting wider nasal airway passages for the elderly. However this was not the case with rhinomanometry values as no significant differences between groups were found. In addition no statistically significant difference was demonstrated in both questionnaires scoring between younger and older subjects. Conclusion The outcome of the NOSE and SNOT questionnaires show no deterioration of quality of life in elderly related with changes in nasal function. Acoustic rhinometry confirmed that nasal cavities are becoming larger across the lifespan.},

  Abstract                 = {Adequate secretion of the nasal mucosa is essential for normal nasal physiology. A â€œdryâ€� nose is a frequent complaint of ENT patients. Measurement of secretion is currently impossible because of the absence of a recognized test. The aim of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of an intranasal Schirmer test in a large number of patients and to define standard values for nasal secretion. The test population comprised 159 healthy, non-smoking volunteers and 30 healthy smoking volunteers. All subjects were examined by nasal endoscopy for anatomic or mucosal disease. A Schirmer test strip was placed on both sides of the mucosa of the anterior nasal septum by anterior rhinoscopy. After 10 min in standardized conditions, the strip was removed and the wetted distance was measured. Active anterior rhinomanometry (ARR) and acoustic rhinometry (AR) were later performed. In the non-smoking group (n = 159), the median wetting distance of the test strip was 10.3 mm (range 3.6â€“35.0 mm). Age, gender, nasal geometry, and flow (according to ARR and AR) had no significant influence on nasal secretion. The test for normal distribution was negative. In the smoking group (n = 30), the median wetting distance was 8.4 mm (range 2.5â€“28.0 mm), significantly shorter than the wetting distance in the non-smoking group (p < 0.05). The Schirmer test offers a practical method to quantify mucosal humidification. The test is inexpensive and well tolerated by patients. In healthy people, wetting distances from 6 to 18 mm are considered normal.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in nasal airflow caused by varying intranasal volumes and cross-sectional areas affect the contact between air and surrounding mucosa entailing alterations in nasal air conditioning. This study evaluates the correlation between nasal air conditioning and the volumes of the inferior and middle turbinates as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fourteen healthy volunteers were enrolled. Each volunteer had been examined by rhinomanometry, acoustic rhinometry, intranasal air temperature, and humidity measurements at defined intranasal sites as well as MRI of the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses. The volumetric data of the turbinates was based on the volumetric software Amira. Comparable results were obtained regarding absolute humidity values and temperature values within the nasal valve area and middle turbinate area for both the right and the left side of the nasal cavity. No statistically significant differences were found in the rhinomanometric values and the acoustic rhinometry results of both sides (p > 0.05). No statistical correlations were found between the volumes of the inferior (mean, 6.1 cm3) and middle turbinate (mean, 1.8 cm3) and the corresponding humidity and temperature values. Additionally, the air temperature and humidity values did not correlate with the rhinometrical endonasal volumes (0-20 mm and 20-50 mm from the nasal entrance). The normal range of volumes of the inferior and middle turbinate does not seem to have a significant impact on intranasal air conditioning in healthy subjects. The exact limits where alterations of the turbinate volume negatively affect nasal air conditioning are still unknown.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool to study the dense gas-solid flow in a circulating fluidized bed. Most of the existing methods focus on the microscopic properties of individual particle. Therefore, the simulation scale is significantly limited by the huge number of individual particles, and so far the numbers of particles in most of the reported simulations are less than 105. The hydrodynamics behaviour of particle clustering in a dense gas-solid two-phase flow has been verified by several experimental results. The Distinct Cluster Method (DCM) was proposed in this paper by studying the macroscopic particle clustering behaviour, and comprehensive models for cluster motion, collision, break-up, and coalescence have been well developed. We model the dense two-phase flow field as gas-rich lean phase and solid-rich cluster phase. The particle cluster is directly treated as one discrete phase. The gas turbulent flow is calculated by Eulerian approach, and the particle behaviour is studied by Lagrangian approach. Using the proposed method, a three-dimension dense gas-particle two-phase flow field in a circulating fluidized bed with square-cross-section, with particle number up to 7.162Â Ã—Â 107 are able to be numerically studied, on which few results have been reported. Details on instantaneous and time-averaged distributions are obtained. Developing process of non-uniform particle distribution is visualized. These results are in agreements with experimental observations, which justified the feasibility of using the DCM method to model and simulate dense gas-solid flow in a circulating fluidized bed with large number of particle numbers.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely used to predict indoor particle and droplet transport and dispersion. CFD solves simplified conservative equations that describe the major characteristics of particle and droplet indoor movement, along with the flow governing equations. This paper reviews the principles of three prevalent CFD models for indoor particle and droplet simulation: the lazy particle model, isothermal particle model and vaporizing droplet model, with a focus on the disparities between these models. The study verifies that different particle and droplet models provide distinct simulation results in which size of particle and droplet is a critical factor. To justify proper application of these models for particles and droplets with different sizes, the paper theoretically analyzes the Lagrangian transport equations for particle and droplet and identifies two crucial time numbers -- particle momentum response time and evaporation lifetime. Upon these numbers, two new indices have been introduced -- Stokes number and evaporation effectiveness number, which can be used as simple criteria to guide the model selection. The case studies confirm the value of the indices and provide the rules of thumb for determining appropriate CFD models for particle and droplet indoor transport under typical room conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel, standardized geometry of the human nasal cavity was created by aligning and processing 30 sets of computed tomography (CT) scans of nasal airways of healthy subjects. Digital three-dimensional (3-D) geometries of the 60 single human nasal cavities (30 right and 30 mirrored left cavities) were generated from the CT scans and measurements of physical parameters of each single nasal cavity were performed. A methodology was developed to scale, orient, and align the nasal geometries, after which 2-D digital coronal cross-sectional slices were generated. With the use of an innovative image processing algorithm, median cross-sectional geometries were created to match median physical parameters while retaining the unique geometric features of the human nasal cavity. From these idealized 2-D images, an original 3-D standardized median human nasal cavity was created. This new standardized geometry was compared against the original geometries of all subjects as well as limited existing data from the literature. The new model has potential for use as a geometric standard in future experimental and numerical studies of deposition of inhaled aerosols, as well as for use as a reference during diagnosis of unhealthy patients. The specific procedure developed could also be applied to build standard nasal geometries for different identifiable groups within the larger population.},

Photographs of particle displacement are obtained in a plane that is parallel to the flow and perpendicular to the walls. These are analyzed to give simultaneous measurements of two components of the velocity at more than 10,000 points. Maps of velocity vectors, spanwise vorticity and Reynolds stress reveal structural aspects of the turbulence. In particular, internal shear layers are observed, in agreement with predictions of direct numerical simulation. Ensemble-averaging of a number of photographs yields statistical properties of the velocity in good agreement with laser-Doppler velocimeter measurements, and with direct numerical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {For inhalation aerosols, it is well known that spray momentum and geometry characteristics can significantly influence deposition in the mouth-throat (MT) region. However, little is know about the quantitative influence of spray momentum on aerosol transport and deposition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of spray momentum on deposition in a standard induction port (IP) and a representative MT geometry using capillary-generated aerosols. Capillary aerosol generation (CAG) was selected as a model spray aerosol system that has not been previously tested in a realistic throat geometry. To evaluate the effects of spray momentum, the transport and deposition characteristics of transient capillary-generated aerosols were compared with ambient particles of the same size inhaled at a steady flow rate of 30Â L/min. To evaluate the influence of geometry, aerosols were considered in a standard IP and a more realistic MT model. A previously tested CFD model was employed to simulate aerosol transport and deposition for ambient and CAG spray aerosols in both the IP and MT geometries. Considering the capillary-generated spray, good agreement was observed for the deposition of drug mass between the in vitro experiments (IP--15.3%, MT--19.4%) and CFD model predictions without droplet evaporation (IP--14.7%, MT--20.8%). In all cases considered, deposition was increased for spray vs. ambient aerosols and in the MT geometry vs. the IP model. Based on CFD results for a representative polydisperse aerosol distribution, the deposition of ambient particles was highly sensitive to the geometry considered, with 2.9 times more deposition in the MT compared to the IP model. In contrast, deposition was less influenced by the geometry for a CAG spray aerosol, with only a 25-40% deposition increase in the MT. As a result, use of the simple IP model may provide a reasonable approximation of total MT deposition for systems with high spray momentum. However, the IP model may be less useful for evaluating the total MT deposition in systems with reduced spray momentum effects.},

Traditional one-dimensional (1-D) whole-lung models are discussed briefly followed by a more in-depth review of three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The review of CFD models is organized into sections covering transport and deposition within the inhaler device, the extrathoracic (oral and nasal) region, conducting airways, and alveolar space. For each section, a general review of significant contributions and advancements in the area of simulating pharmaceutical aerosols is provided followed by a more in-depth application or case study that highlights the challenges, utility, and benefits of in silico models. Specific applications presented include the optimization of an existing spray inhaler, development of charge-targeted delivery, specification of conditions for optimal nasal delivery, analysis of a new condensational delivery approach, and an evaluation of targeted delivery using magnetic aerosols. The review concludes with recommendations on the need for more refined model validations, use of a concurrent experimental and CFD approach for developing aerosol delivery systems, and development of a stochastic individual path (SIP) model of aerosol transport and deposition throughout the respiratory tract.},

  Abstract                 = {Individual and interacting effects of uniform flow, plane shear, and near-wall proximity on spherical droplet heat and mass transfer have been assessed for low Reynolds number conditions beyond the creeping flow regime. Validated resolved volume simulations were used to compute heat and mass transfer surface gradients of two-dimensional axisymmetric droplets and three-dimensional spherical droplets near planar wall boundaries for conditions consistent with inhalable aerosols (5Â [less-than-or-equals, slant]Â dÂ [less-than-or-equals, slant]Â 300 [mu]m) in the upper respiratory tract. Results indicate that planar shear significantly impacts droplet heat and mass transfer for shear-based Reynolds numbers greater than 1, which occur for near-wall respiratory aerosols with diameters in excess of 50 [mu]m. Wall proximity is shown to significantly enhance heat and mass transfer due to conduction and diffusion at separation distances less than five particle diameters and for small Reynolds numbers. For the Reynolds number conditions of interest, significant non-linear effects arise due to the concurrent interaction of uniform flow and shear such that linear superposition of Sherwood or Nusselt number terms is not allowable. Based on the validated numeric simulations, multivariable Sherwood and Nusselt number correlations are provided to account for individual flow characteristics and concurrent non-linear interactions of uniform flow, planar shear, and near-wall proximity. These heat and mass transfer correlations can be applied to effectively compute condensation and evaporation rates of potentially toxic or therapeutic aerosols in the upper respiratory tract, where non-uniform flow and wall proximity are expected to significantly affect droplet transport, deposition, and vapor formation.},

  Abstract                 = {This study describes an effective method for one-way coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations of spherical micro-size particles, including particle-wall interactions and the quantification of near-wall stasis at possibly elevated concentrations. The focus is on particle-hemodynamics simulations where particle suspensions are composed of critical blood cells, such as monocytes, and the carrier fluid is non-Newtonian. Issues regarding adaptive time-step integration of the particle motion equation, relevant point-force model terms, and adaptation of surface-induced particle forces to arbitrary three-dimensional geometries are outlined. By comparison to available experimental trajectories, it is shown that fluid-element pathlines may be used to simulate non-interacting blood particles removed from wall boundaries under dilute transient conditions. However, when particle-wall interactions are significant, an extended form of the particle trajectory equation is required which includes terms for Stokes drag, near-wall drag modifications, or lubrication forces, pressure gradients, and near-wall particle lift. Still, additional physical and/or biochemical wall forces in the nano-meter range cannot be readily calculated; hence the near-wall residence time (NWRT) model indicating the probability of blood particle deposition is presented. The theory is applied to a virtual model of a femoral bypass end-to-side anastomosis, where profiles of the Lagrangian-based NWRT parameter are illustrated and convergence is verified. In order to effectively compute the large number of particle trajectories required to resolve regions of particle stasis, the proposed particle tracking algorithm stores all transient velocity field solution data on a shared memory architecture (SGI Origin 2400) and computes particle trajectories using an adaptive parallel approach. Compared to commercially available particle tracking packages, the algorithm presented is capable of reducing computational time by an order of magnitude for typical transient one-way coupled blood particle simulations in complex cyclical flow domains.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulations of fine aerosols (100Â nm ) in the respiratory tract are challenging due to low particle deposition rates and the combined effects of diffusional and inertial deposition mechanisms. Furthermore, validations of fine respiratory aerosol deposition are difficult due to a lack of localized experimental data. The objective of this study is to develop and test a continuous two-phase model for simulating the regional and local deposition of dilute fine aerosols in an idealized double bifurcation segment of the respiratory tract. To evaluate the developed transport model, novel in vitro deposition results for 400Â nm particles have been determined in a double bifurcation geometry of respiratory generations G3-G5. In addition, previously reported local deposition characteristics for aerosols have also been considered. Computational two-phase models that have been evaluated include a standard chemical species (CS) mass fraction approximation, the drift flux (DF) approach to account for finite particle inertia, and two novel extensions of the DF model to correct for near-wall particle velocity. The first velocity correction model (DF-VC1) applies a continuous field solution for particle slip at the wall surface. As an alternative, a sub-grid near-wall Lagrangian solution has been proposed as the DF-VC2 model. Localized experimental results for the deposition of 400Â nm particles indicated elevated deposition contours ranging from 1% to 5% of total deposition at the first bifurcation and 0.1-1% at the second. Of the computational models tested, the DF-VC2 method provided the best match to experimental deposition values on a regional and highly localized basis. Specifically, the DF-VC2 model matched total experimental deposition results to within 10% for both 400Â nm and particles. Considering the local deposition of fine aerosols, the DF-VC2 model matched the experimentally determined elevated contours at the first and second bifurcations for both 400Â nm and particles. In conclusion, a DF particle transport model with near-wall velocity corrections appears to provide a highly effective solution for the deposition of fine respiratory aerosols.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of research studies have employed a wide variety of mesh styles and levels of grid convergence to assess velocity fields and particle deposition patterns in models of branching biological systems. Generating structured meshes based on hexahedral elements requires significant time and effort; however, these meshes are often associated with high quality solutions. Unstructured meshes that employ tetrahedral elements can be constructed much faster but may increase levels of numerical diffusion, especially in tubular flow systems with a primary flow direction. The objective of this study is to better establish the effects of mesh generation techniques and grid convergence on velocity fields and particle deposition patterns in bifurcating respiratory models. In order to achieve this objective, four widely used mesh styles including structured hexahedral, unstructured tetrahedral, flow adaptive tetrahedral, and hybrid grids have been considered for two respiratory airway configurations. Initial particle conditions tested are based on the inlet velocity profile or the local inlet mass flow rate. Accuracy of the simulations has been assessed by comparisons to experimental in vitro data available in the literature for the steady-state velocity field in a single bifurcation model as well as the local particle deposition fraction in a double bifurcation model. Quantitative grid convergence was assessed based on a grid convergence index (GCI), which accounts for the degree of grid refinement. The hexahedral mesh was observed to have GCI values that were an order of magnitude below the unstructured tetrahedral mesh values for all resolutions considered. Moreover, the hexahedral mesh style provided GCI values of approximately 1% and reduced run times by a factor of 3. Based on comparisons to empirical data, it was shown that inlet particle seedings should be consistent with the local inlet mass flow rate. Furthermore, the mesh style was found to have an observable effect on cumulative particle depositions with the hexahedral solution most closely matching empirical results. Future studies are needed to assess other mesh generation options including various forms of the hybrid configuration and unstructured hexahedral meshes.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of asthma induced airway constriction on aerosol dynamics and particle deposition have been investigated in bifurcating models of pediatric airways. Geometries considered include double bifurcation models of upper (G3-G5) and central (G7-G9) airways for a four-year-old child under healthy and 30% constricted conditions. Steady inhalation flow rates consistent with sedentary, light and high activity conditions have been employed. For this study, the deposition patterns of particles ranging from 1 to have been evaluated in terms of branch-averaged filtering efficiencies and highly localized cellular-level deposition rates. These cellular-level deposition values were calculated within diameter regions based on a novel microdosimetry factor. For both upper and central airway models, airway constriction increased branch-averaged filtering efficiencies by factors ranging from 1.5 to 10. More significantly, airway constriction was found to increase local cellular-level deposition rates by one to two orders of magnitude, as encapsulated by the microdosimetry factor. Based on these results, asthma constriction is observed to induce a significant increase in branch-averaged particle deposition as well as an even larger increase in local cellular-level deposition and cellular burden. These increased cellular-level deposition values may translate to an increased health risk associated with the inhalation of particulate matter in cases of asthma related bronchoconstriction.},

  Abstract                 = {An interferometric study and a numerical simulation are presented of the combined process of the bulk turbulent convection and the dynamic of a vapor bubble which is formed in the superheated boundary layer of a subcooled flowing liquid, in order to determine the heat transfer to the flowing subcooled liquid. In this investigation focus has been given on a single vapor bubble at a defined cavity site to provide reproducible conditions. In the experimental study single bubbles were generated at a single artificial cavity by means of a CO2-laser as a spot heater at a uniformly heated wall of a vertical rectangular channel with water as the test fluid. The experiments were performed at various degrees of subcooling and mass flow rates. The bubble growth and the temporal decrease of the bubble volume were captured by means of the high-speed cinematography. The thermal boundary layer and the temperature field at the phase-interface between fluid and bubble were visualized by means of the optical measurement method holographic interferometry with a high temporal and spatial resolution, and thus the local and temporal heat transfer could be quantified. The experimental results form a significant data basis for the description of the mean as well as the local heat transfer as a function of the flow conditions. According to the experimental configuration and the obtained data the numerical simulations were performed. A numerical method has been developed to simulate the influence of single bubbles on the surrounding fluid which is based on a Lagrangian approach to describe the motion of the bubbles. The method is coupled to a large-eddy simulations by the body force term which is locally evaluated based on the density field. The obtained experimental data correspond well with the numerical predictions, both of which demonstrate the thermo- and fluiddynamic characteristics of the interaction between the vapor bubble and the subcooled liquid.},

  Abstract                 = {The advent of endoscopic sinus surgery led to a resurgence of interest in the detailed anatomy of the internal nose and paranasal sinuses. However, the official Terminologica Anatomica used by basic anatomists omits many of the structures of surgical importance. This led to numerous clinical anatomy papers and much discussion about the exact names and definitions for the structures of surgical relevance. This European Position Paper on the Anatomical Terminology of the Internal Nose and Paranasal Sinuses was conceived to re-evaluate the anatomical terms in common usage by endoscopic sinus surgeons and to compare this with the official Terminologica Anatomica. The text is a concise summary of all the structures encountered during routine endoscopic surgery in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and at the interface with the orbit and skull base but does not provide a comprehensive text for advanced skull base surgery. It draws on a detailed review of the literature and provides a consensus where several options are available, defining the anatomical structure in simple terms and in English. It is recognised that this is an area of great variation and some indication of the frequency with which these variants are encountered is given in the text and table. All major anatomical points are illustrated, drawing on the expertise of the multi-national and multi-disciplinary contributors to this project.},

  Abstract                 = {A new numerical approach for modeling a class of flow-structure interaction problems typically encountered in biological systems is presented. In this approach, a previously developed, sharp-interface, immersed-boundary method for incompressible flows is used to model the fluid flow and a new, sharp-interface Cartesian grid, immersed-boundary method is devised to solve the equations of linear viscoelasticity that governs the solid. The two solvers are coupled to model flow-structure interaction. This coupled solver has the advantage of simple grid generation and efficient computation on simple, single-block structured grids. The accuracy of the solid-mechanics solver is examined by applying it to a canonical problem. The solution methodology is then applied to the problem of laryngeal aerodynamics and vocal fold vibration during human phonation. This includes a three-dimensional eigen analysis for a multi-layered vocal fold prototype as well as two-dimensional, flow-induced vocal fold vibration in a modeled larynx. Several salient features of the aerodynamics as well as vocal fold dynamics are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The inspiratory flow characteristics in a CT-scanned human lung model were numerically investigated using low Reynolds number (LRN) [kappa]-[omega] turbulent model. The five-generation airway is extracted from the trachea to segmental bronchi of a 60-year-old Chinese male patient. Computations were carried out in the Reynolds number range of 900-2100, corresponding to mouth-air breathing rates of 190-440Â ml/s. Flow patterns on the Re=2100 and flow rate distribution were presented. In this model, the flow pattern is very complex. To count the effect of laryngeal jet on trachea inlet, the trachea was extended and modified to simulate the larynx, consequently the inlet velocity profile is biased towards the rear wall. In the inferior lobar bronchi, there are two stems in which the axial velocity is stronger but secondary velocity is weaker. Secondary flow in the lateral bronchi is stronger than the medial ones. With increasing Re, the air flow increases in the middle, inferior lobes and left main bronchus, i.e., flow biases to left and downward.},

  Abstract                 = {Detailed information about the flow field pattern is highly important in accurately predicting particle deposition sites in the human airway. Flow in the upper airway during heavy breathing can have a Reynolds number as high as 9300, and therefore presents turbulent features. Although turbulence is believed to have an important effect on the airflow and other transport processes in the bronchial tree, to date both theoretical and numerical studies have predominantly assumed the flow to be laminar. In this paper, transitional/turbulent flow during inspiration is studied using a large eddy simulation (LES) in a single asymmetric bifurcation model of human upper airway. The influence of the non-laminar flow on the patterns and the particle paths is investigated in both 2D and 3D models. Throughout the investigation, comparisons with the laminar and conventional k-[var epsilon] models for the same configuration and flow conditions are made. The LES model is also carefully validated against published experimental data in a stenotic tube model. The results demonstrate that the LES model is capable of capturing instantaneous eddy formation and flow separation in (almost) laminar, transitional and turbulent flow regimes, and hence may be used as a powerful and practical tool to provide much of the detailed flow information required for tracing the particle trajectories and particle deposition in human airways.},

  Abstract                 = {In the avian lung, inhaled air is shunted past the openings of the medioventral secondary bronchi (MVSB) by a mechanism termed [`]inspiratory aerodynamic valving' (IAV). Sizes and orientations of the trachea (Tr), syrinx (Sx), extrapulmonary primary bronchus (EPPB), intrapulmonary primary bronchus (IPPB), MVSB, mediodorsal secondary bronchi (MDSB), lateroventral secondary bronchi (LVSB) and the ostium (Ot) were determined in the ostrich, Struthio camelus. Air flow was simulated through computationally generated models and its dynamics analysed. The [`]truncated normal model' (TNM) consisted of the Tr, Sx, EPPB, IPPB, MVSB and the Ot. For the [`]inclusive normal model' (INM), the MDSB and the LDSB were added. Variations of these models included the [`]truncated MVSB1 rotated model' (TMVSB1RM), the [`]truncated constriction fitted model' (TCFM) and the [`]inclusive MVSB1 rotated model' (IMVSB1RM). In the TNM, the TMVSB1RM and the TCFM, the air flow exited through the MVSB while for the INM and the IMVSB1RM, very little of it did: IAV did not occur in the partial models. In the IMVSB1RM, rotating the MVSB1 clockwise did not affect IAV. The incomplete models may be faulty because the velocity/pressure profiles in different parts of the interconnected airways form an integrated functional continuum in which different parts of the system considerably impact on each other.},

The principle and the application on open channel flow of 3D PTV are briefly described in the first part of this paper. By decomposition of the velocity vectors velocity profiles and turbulence intensities are derived and presented in the second part. Turbulent energy dissipation, Kolmogorov length and time scales and Taylor micro scales are computed from the measured data sets. In the Lagrangian analysis pdf's of the Lagrangian acceleration, correlation coefficients and Taylor micro scales are determined. The individual determination of the particle positions and displacements allows finally the application on the one and two particle approaches for turbulent diffusion from Taylor (1921), Richardson (1926) and Batchelor (1949, 1952).},

  Abstract                 = {The Large Eddy Simulation of closed-loop active flow control applied to a 3D cavity excited by a compressible airflow with a Mach number of 0.6 is presented. The control actuator is an idealized synthetic jet located at the upstream cavity edge, and the control function is supplied by a feedback LMS-type algorithm whose input is a pressure signal measured inside the cavity. The radiated sound, provided directly by the LES simulation, was shown to decrease substantially when active control was applied. A simultaneous reduction of the vertical velocity fluctuations in the shear layer was observed. The intensity of vortical structures inside the cavity was also reduced, although the general aspect of the recirculation zone was not modified. The direct noise computation technique, which supplies the pressure field by solving the fluid mechanics equations, is shown to constitute a powerful tool for studying active aeroacoustic noise control.

  Abstract                 = {A multiple-time step computational approach is presented for efficient discrete-element modeling of aerosol flows containing adhesive solid particles. Adhesive aerosol particulates are found in numerous dust and smoke contamination problems, including smoke particle transport in the lungs, particle clogging of heat exchangers in construction vehicles, industrial nanoparticle transport and filtration systems, and dust fouling of electronic systems and MEMS components. Dust fouling of equipment is of particular concern for potential human occupation on dusty planets, such as Mars. The discrete-element method presented in this paper can be used for prediction of aggregate structure and breakup, for prediction of the effect of aggregate formation on the bulk fluid flow, and for prediction of the effects of small-scale flow features (e.g., due to surface roughness or MEMS patterning) on the aggregate formation. After presentation of the overall computational structure, the forces and torques acting on the particles resulting from fluid motion, particle-particle collision, and adhesion under van der Waals forces are reviewed. The effect of various parameters of normal collision and adhesion of two particles are examined in detail. The method is then used to examine aggregate formation and particle clogging in pipe and channel flow.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study, trajectories of inhaled particulate matter (PM) were simulated within a three-dimensional (3-D) computer model of the human upper respiratory tract (URT). The airways were described by computer-reconstructed images of a silicone rubber cast of the human head, throat, and trachea and main bronchi. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of airflow patterns were performed using commercially available software (CFX-F3D) on a Sun Sparc-5 workstation. For each simulation, particles were introduced within a nostril grid and their trajectories calculated. A typical computer run of 400 iterations took 25 h. Particle deposition was designated in nasal (N), laryngeal (L), and tracheobronchial (T) regions, or penetration (P) of the URT. Deposition was calculated as a function of particle size (0.5-5 [mu]m), density (1 and 2 g/cm3), and flow rate (9, 17, and 34 l/min). The computations should be addressed on a case-by-case basis as detailed herein; however, it can be stated that in a given N, L, or T region, deposition fractions as determined by the calculation of trajectories increased more with flow rate than particle size. This knowledge of factors affecting particle trajectories and deposition patterns may have important implications for PM risk assessment programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Numerical results from a computational and experimental research program directed towards understanding cavity noise attenuation using a vortex generator placed within the boundary layer, just upstream the cavity, are presented. A LES computation, based on the compressible filtered Navier-Stokes equations, is conducted to show the effects of such suppression resonance device. Wall functions and a local mesh refinement technique are used in a multi-block structured solver to reduce the computational cost of the simulation. The M219 cavity has been retained for this study and the inflow Mach number is equal to 0.85. Inflow boundary conditions are prescribed using profiles obtained from a RANS boundary layer calculation. The results obtained show that the vortex generator device reduces significantly and simultaneously the four Rossiter modes which are driven by the strong interaction between shear layer dynamics and acoustic propagation, leading to a self-sustained resonance phenomenon. No similar behavior is observed with the controlled cavity, in which a flat plate of zero thickness across the cavity generates a von Karman street and the resulting vortices, impinging in the rear part, do not produced strong acoustic tones.},

  Abstract                 = {Combustion-derived and synthetic nano-sized particles (NSP) have gained considerable interest among pulmonary researchers and clinicians for two main reasons. 1) Inhalation exposure to combustion-derived NSP was associated with increased pulmonary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as suggested by epidemiological studies. Experimental evidence has provided a mechanistic picture of the adverse health effects associated with inhalation of combustion-derived and synthetic NSP. 2) The toxicological potential of NSP contrasts with the potential application of synthetic NSP in technological as well as medicinal settings, with the latter including the use of NSP as diagnostics or therapeutics. To shed light on this paradox, this article aims to highlight recent findings about the interaction of inhaled NSP with the structures of the respiratory tract including surfactant, alveolar macrophages, and epithelial cells. Cellular responses to NSP exposure include the generation of reactive oxygen species and the induction of an inflammatory response. Furthermore, this review places special emphasis on methodological differences between experimental studies and the caveats associated with the dose metrics and points out ways to overcome inherent methodological problems.},

It is based on a generalized reaction force that enforces no-slip boundary conditions at the fluid-body interface as the limiting case of an iterative procedure. A smooth version of the Heaviside function allows to treat spherical particles of arbitrary size and produces smooth hydrodynamic forces as particles move in the continuum. Numerical tests demonstrate the accuracy of the method in reproducing the hydrodynamic field around a single particle and the fluid-mediated forces between pairs of particles. The drag force experienced by a particle moving in a straight channel and at various Reynolds numbers is studied as a non-trivial testcase.},

  Abstract                 = {{In principle, to achieve the most natural and harmonious rejuvenation of the face, all changes that result from the aging process should be corrected. Traditionally, soft tissue lifting and redraping have constituted the cornerstone of most facial rejuvenation procedures. Changes in the facial skeleton that occur with aging and their impact on facial appearance have not been well appreciated. Accordingly, failure to address changes in the skeletal foundation of the face may limit the potential benefit of any rejuvenation procedure. Correction of the skeletal framework is increasingly viewed as the new frontier in facial rejuvenation. It currently is clear that certain areas of the facial skeleton undergo resorption with aging. Areas with a strong predisposition to resorption include the midface skeleton, particularly the maxilla including the pyriform region of the nose, the superomedial and inferolateral aspects of the orbital rim, and the prejowl area of the mandible. These areas resorb in a specific and predictable manner with aging. The resultant deficiencies of the skeletal foundation contribute to the stigmata of the aging face. In patients with a congenitally weak skeletal structure, the skeleton may be the primary cause for the manifestations of premature aging. These areas should be specifically examined in patients undergoing facial rejuvenation and addressed to obtain superior aesthetic results.

  Abstract                 = {A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) programme was used to study dysphagia, a swallowing disorder, and demonstrated that the rheological properties of a liquid affect the pharyngeal transport of a food bolus. A fully coupled, Newton-Raphson solution algorithm was used in conjunction with the Backward-Euler scheme. Concomitant axial and radial movement of the fluid bolus was assumed, and the force exerted by the base of the tongue was assumed to be linear. Boundary conditions were based on data published in the clinical literature. The properties of three fluid types were modelled: water ([rho] = 1000 kg m-3, [eta] = 0.001 Pa s), 250% w/v barium sulfate mixture ([rho] = 1800 kg m-3, [eta] = 0.150 Pa s), and and starch-thickened beverage (power law parameters K = 2.0 Pa sn, n = 0.7). Results show that when the base of the tongue pushes against the throat with the same amount of force, water is transported through the pharynx at a much higher flow rate than the barium sulphate mixture, causing parts of the water bolus to flow backwards. A typical starch-thickened beverage, which is a shear-thinning non-Newtonian fluid, undergoes much lower flow rates. Furthermore, under the same conditions, a smaller volume of the non-Newtonian bolus (2 mL compared to 20 mL of the Newtonian fluids) is passed through by the end of the swallow. Values for the time to swallow a critical bolus volume, tcv, show that non-Newtonian fluids increase swallowing time more effectively than Newtonian fluids and are thus safer to swallow for patients with dysphagia. These findings suggest that non-Newtonian foods may either slow down the swallowing process or trigger the subject to swallow a smaller amount, allowing the neuromuscular system more time to shut off air passages and reduce the risk of aspiration. Based on this simple CFD modelling of the swallowing process, the effects of fluid properties on bolus transit can be predicted.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational fluid dynamics techniques employing primarily steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methodology have been recently used to characterize the transitional/turbulent flow field in human airways. The use of RANS implies that flow phenomena are averaged over time, the flow dynamics not being captured. Further, RANS uses two-equation turbulence models that are not adequate for predicting anisotropic flows, flows with high streamline curvature, or flows where separation occurs. A more accurate approach for such flow situations that occur in the human airway is Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The paper considers flow modeling in a pharyngeal airway model reconstructed from cross-sectional magnetic resonance scans of a patient with obstructive sleep apnea. The airway model is characterized by a maximum narrowing at the site of retropalatal pharynx. Two flow-modeling strategies are employed: steady RANS and the LES approach. In the RANS modeling framework both k-[epsilon] and k-[omega] turbulence models are used. The paper discusses the differences between the airflow characteristics obtained from the RANS and LES calculations. The largest discrepancies were found in the axial velocity distributions downstream of the minimum cross-sectional area. This region is characterized by flow separation and large radial velocity gradients across the developed shear layers. The largest difference in static pressure distributions on the airway walls was found between the LES and the k-[epsilon] data at the site of maximum narrowing in the retropalatal pharynx.},

  Abstract                 = {Rationale: Increased exposure to particulate air pollution (PM10) is a risk factor for death and hospitalization with cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that the nanoparticulate component of PM10 is capable of translocating into the circulation with the potential for direct effects on the vasculature. Objective: The study's aim was to determine the extent to which inhaled technetium-99m (99mTc)-labeled carbon nanoparticles (Technegas) were able to access the systemic circulation. Methods and Main Results: Ten healthy volunteers inhaled Technegas and blood samples were taken sequentially over the following 6 h. Technegas particles were 4-20 nm in diameter and aggregated to a median particle diameter of approximately 100 nm. Radioactivity was immediately detected in blood, with levels increasing over 60 min. Thin-layer chromatography of whole blood identified a species that moved with the solvent front, corresponding to unbound 99mTc-pertechnetate, which was excreted in urine. There was no evidence of particle-bound 99mTc at the origin. {gamma} Camera images demonstrated high levels of Technegas retention (95.6 {+/-} 1.7% at 6 h) in the lungs, with no accumulation of radioactivity detected over the liver or spleen. Conclusions: The majority of 99mTc-labeled carbon nanoparticles remain within the lung up to 6 h after inhalation. In contrast to previous published studies, thin-layer chromatography did not support the hypothesis that inhaled Technegas carbon nanoparticles pass directly from the lungs into the systemic circulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Now a day's intranasal (i.n) drug delivery is emerging as a reliable method to bypass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and deliver a wide range of therapeutic agents including both small and large molecules, growth factors, viral vectors and even stem cells to the brain and has shown therapeutic effects in both animals and humans. This route involves the olfactory or trigeminal nerve systems which initiate in the brain and terminate in the nasal cavity at the olfactory neuroepithelium or respiratory epithelium. They are the only externally exposed portions of the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore represent the most direct method of noninvasive entry into the brain. This approach has been primarily used to explore therapeutic avenues for neurological diseases. The potential for treatment possibilities with olfactory transfer of drugs will increase as more effective formulations and delivery devices are developed. Recently, the apomorphine hydrochloride dry powders have been developed for i.n. delivery (Apomorphine nasal, Lyonase technology, Britannia Pharmaceuticals, Surrey, UK). The results of clinical trial Phase III suggested that the prepared formulation had clinical effect equivalent to subcutaneously administered apomorphine. In coming years, intranasal delivery of drugs will demand more complex and automated delivery devices to ensure accurate and repeatable dosing. Thus, new efforts are needed to make this noninvasive route of delivery more efficient and popular, and it is also predicted that in future a range of intranasal products will be used in diagnosis as well as treatment of CNS diseases. This review will embark the existing evidence of nose-to-brain transport. It also provides insights into the most relevant pre-clinical studies of direct nose-brain delivery and delivery devices which will provide relative success of intranasal delivery system. We have, herein, outlined the relevant aspects of CNS drugs given intranasally to direct the brain in treating CNS disorders like Alzheimer's disease, depression, migraine, schizophrenia, etc.},

  Abstract                 = {With advancing age, the ability of humans to detect and discriminate odors declines. In light of the rapid progress in analyzing molecular and structural correlates of developing and adult olfactory systems, the paucity of information available on the aged olfactory system is startling. A rich literature documents the decline of olfactory acuity in aged humans, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Using animal models, preliminary work is beginning to uncover differences between young and aged rodents that may help address the deficits seen in humans, but many questions remain unanswered. Recent studies of odorant receptor (OR) expression, synaptic organization, adult neurogenesis, and the contribution of cortical representation during aging suggest possible underlying mechanisms and new research directions. },

  Abstract                 = {Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is the major disorder of the upper airways, affecting about 10-15% of the total population. Topical treatment regimens show only modest efficacy, because drug delivery to the posterior nose and paranasal sinuses is still a challenge. Therefore, there is a high rate of functional endoscopic sinus surgery in CRS patients. Most nasally administered aerosolized drugs, like nasal pump sprays, are efficiently filtered by the nasal valve and do not reach the posterior nasal cavity and the sinuses, which are poorly ventilated. However, as highlighted in this review, sinus ventilation and paranasal aerosol delivery can be achieved by using pulsating airflow, offering new topical treatment options for nasal disorders. Radioaerosol inhalation and imaging studies in nasal casts and in healthy volunteers have shown 4-6% of the nasally administered dose within the sinuses. In CRS patients, significant aerosol deposition in the sinus cavities was reported before sinus surgery. After surgery, deposition increased to the amount observed in healthy volunteers. In addition, compared with nasal pump sprays, retention kinetics of the radiolabel deposited in the nasal cavity was prolonged, both in healthy volunteers and in CRS patients. These efficiencies may be sufficient for topical aerosol therapies of sinus disorders and, due to the prolonged retention kinetics, may reduce application modes, but have to be proven in future clinical trials. Pulsating aerosols may offer additional new topical treatment options of nasal and sinus disorders before as well as after surgery.},

  Abstract                 = {Three dimensional computational models of both sides of human nasal passages were developed to investigate the effect of septal deviation on the flow patterns and deposition of micro/nano-particles in the realistic human nasal airways before and after septoplasty. A series of coronal CT scan images from a live 25-year old nonsmoking male with septal deviation in his right nasal passage was used to construct the model. For low to moderate activities, the steady airflows through the nasal passages were simulated. Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches were used, respectively, for nano- and micro-particles. The results show that the flow field and particle deposition strongly depend on the passage geometry especially for micro particles. In particular, the deposition rate in the passage with septal deviation was much higher compared with those in the normal (left) passage and the postoperative passage. Despite the similarity of total micro-particle deposition in the postoperative and the normal cavities, the regional deposition patterns were quite different in these passages. The deposition of nano-particles, however, showed similar trends in the postoperative right nasal passage and the normal left passage. The simulation results showed that in addition to the major alteration of the airflow pattern after the septoplasty operation, there are significant changes in the deposition pattern of nano- and micro-particles. Despite the anatomical differences between the available experimental configuration and the present computer model, the simulation results for the deposition efficiency of particles of different sizes are in qualitative agreement with the available data.},

  Abstract                 = {Spherical monodisperse ferromagnetic iron oxide particles of 1.9 mum geometric and 4.2 mum aerodynamic diameter were inhaled by seven patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) using the shallow bolus technique, and compared to 13 healthy non-smokers (NS) from a previous study. The bolus penetration front depth was limiting to the phase1 dead space volume. In PCD patients deposition was 58+/-8 % after 8 s breath holding time. Particle retention was measured by the magnetopneumographic method over a period of nine months. Particle clearance from the airways showed a fast and a slow phase. In PCD patients airway clearance was retarded and prolonged, 42+/-12 % followed the fast phase with a mean half time of 16.8+/-8.6 hours. The remaining fraction was cleared slowly with a half time of 121+/-25 days. In healthy NS 49+/-9 % of particles were cleared in the fast phase with a mean half time of 3.0+/-1.6 hours, characteristic of an intact mucociliary clearance. There was no difference in the slow clearance phase between PCD patients and healthy NS. Despite non-functioning cilia the effectiveness of airway clearance in PCD patients is comparable to healthy NS, with a prolonged kinetics of one week, which may primarily reflect the effectiveness of cough clearance. This prolonged airway clearance allows longer residence times of bacteria and viruses in the airways and may be one reason for increased frequency of infections in PCD patients.},

  Abstract                 = {We have reviewed the literature relating to the health effects of diesel emissions with particular reference to acute and chronic morbidity and to carcinogenicity. It is apparent that exposure to diesel fumes in sufficient concentrations may lead to eye and nasal irritation but there is no evidence of any permanent effect. A transient decline of ventilatory capacity has been noted following such exposures. There is also some evidence that the chronic inhalation of diesel fumes leads to the development of cough and sputum, that is chronic bronchitis, however, it is usually impossible to show a cause and effect relationship because of the concomitant and confounding exposures to mine dust and cigarette smoke. Although there have been a number of papers suggesting that diesel fumes may act as an carcinogen, the weight of the evidence is against this hypothesis. Finally, the role of small particles, less than 10 {micro}m, which are frequently present in diesel emissions requires further study since there is some limited evidence that they may be partly responsible for some of the exacerbations of asthma.

  Abstract                 = {A 3D simulation study for an incompressible slip flow around a spherical aerosol particle was performed. The full Navier-Stokes equations were solved and the velocity jump at the gas-particle interface was treated numerically by imposition of the slip boundary condition. Analytical solution to the Stokesian slip flow past a spherical particle was used as a benchmark for code verification, and excellent agreement was achieved. The simulation results showed that in addition to the Knudsen number, the Reynolds number affects the slip correction factor. Thus, the Cunningham-based slip corrections must be augmented by the inclusion of the effect of Reynolds number for application to Lagrangian tracking of fine particles. A new expression for the slip correction factor as a function of both Knudsen number and Reynolds number was developed. The particle total drag coefficient was also correlated against Re and Kn over the range of gas-particle relative speeds yielding the incompressible slip flow from the Stokesian regime up to the threshold of compressibility. Inclusion of gas slip on the particle surface enhances the accuracy of particle drag force prediction up to 40.9% in the range of 0.01<Kn<0.1 and 0.125<Re<20 compared to the no-slip continuum drag values.},

  Abstract                 = {As the fine particles expose to the rarefied regimes, the solid-surface effects become prominent and change the interfacial interactions between the gas and particle. The particle drag force, which is mainly concerned in aerosol researches, is affected through the changes observed in the way that fluid entities reflect from the particle surface. A 3D simulation study for an incompressible rarefied slip flow past a spherical aerosol particle was performed. The full Navier-Stokes equations were solved and the velocity jump at the gas-particle interface was treated numerically by imposition of the slip boundary condition. Analytical solution to the Stokesian slip flow past a spherical particle was used as a benchmark for code verification, and reasonable agreement was achieved. The simulation results showed that in addition to the Knudsen number, the Reynolds number affects the slip correction factor. Thus, the Cunningham-based slip corrections must be augmented by the inclusion of the effect of Reynolds number for application to Lagrangian tracking of fine particles. A novel expression for the surface-slip correction factor as a function of both Knudsen number (0.01Â <Â KnÂ <Â 0.1) and Reynolds number (0Â <Â ReÂ <Â 1) was developed.},

  Abstract                 = {Inhalation of air-dispersed sub-micrometre and nano-sized particles presents a risk factor for animal and human health. Here, we show that nasal aerodynamics plays a pivotal role in the protection of the subterranean mole vole Ellobius talpinus from an increased exposure to nano-aerosols. Quantitative simulation of particle flow has shown that their deposition on the total surface of the nasal cavity is higher in the mole vole than in a terrestrial rodent Mus musculus (mouse), but lower on the olfactory epithelium. In agreement with simulation results, we found a reduced accumulation of manganese in olfactory bulbs of mole voles in comparison with mice after the inhalation of nano-sized MnCl2 aerosols. We ruled out the possibility that this reduction is owing to a lower transportation from epithelium to brain in the mole vole as intranasal instillations of MnCl2 solution and hydrated nanoparticles of manganese oxide MnO Â· (H2O)x revealed similar uptake rates for both species. Together, we conclude that nasal geometry contributes to the protection of brain and lung from accumulation of air-dispersed particles in mole voles. 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  Abstract                 = {Combustion-derived and synthetic nano-sized particles (NSP) have gained considerable interest among pulmonary researchers and clinicians for two main reasons. 1) Inhalation exposure to combustion-derived NSP was associated with increased pulmonary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as suggested by epidemiological studies. Experimental evidence has provided a mechanistic picture of the adverse health effects associated with inhalation of combustion-derived and synthetic NSP. 2) The toxicological potential of NSP contrasts with the potential application of synthetic NSP in technological as well as medicinal settings, with the latter including the use of NSP as diagnostics or therapeutics. To shed light on this paradox, this article aims to highlight recent findings about the interaction of inhaled NSP with the structures of the respiratory tract including surfactant, alveolar macrophages, and epithelial cells. Cellular responses to NSP exposure include the generation of reactive oxygen species and the induction of an inflammatory response. Furthermore, this review places special emphasis on methodological differences between experimental studies and the caveats associated with the dose metrics and points out ways to overcome inherent methodological problems.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing incidence of indoor airborne infections has prompted attention upon the investigation of expiratory droplet dispersion and transport in built environments. In this study, a source (i.e. a patient who generates droplets) and a receiver (i.e. a susceptible object other than the source) are modeled in a mechanically ventilated room. The receiver's exposure to the droplet nuclei is analyzed under two orientations relative to the source. Two droplet nuclei, 0.1 and 10Â [mu]m, with different emission velocities, are selected to represent large expiratory droplets which can still be inhaled into the human respiratory tracts. The droplet dispersion and mixing characteristics under well-mixed and displacement ventilation schemes are evaluated and compared numerically. Results show that the droplet dispersion and mixing under displacement ventilation is consistently poorer. Very low concentration regions are also observed in the displacement scheme. For both ventilation schemes, the intake dose will be reduced substantially if the droplets are emitted under the face-to-wall orientation rather than the face-to-face orientation. Implications of using engineering strategies for reducing exposure are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The implementation of artificial ventilation schemes is necessary when respiration fails. One approach involves the application of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) to the respiratory system. Oscillatory airflow in the upper bronchial tree can be characterized by Reynolds numbers as high as 104, hence, the flow presents turbulent features. In this study, transitional and turbulent flow within an asymmetric bifurcating model of the upper airway during HFOV are studied using large eddy simulation (LES) methods. The flow, characterized by a peak Reynolds number of 8132, is analysed using a validated LES model of a three-dimensional branching geometry. The pressures, velocities, and vorticity within the flow are presented and compared with prior models for branching flow systems. The results demonstrate how pendelluft occurs at asymmetric branches within the respiratory system. These results may be useful in optimising treatments using HFOV methods.},

  Abstract                 = {A new thrust in the use of CFD techniques for simulation of biological flows has necessitated the demand for robust grid generation techniques to characterize the complex geometries. While the techniques of image manipulation required are simple, most researchers in this field use proprietary 3rd party software for image manipulation and grid generation. In the current study, we propose a simple MATLAB based grid generation techniques suitable for CFD studies of external and internal biological flows such as blood flow and respiration and flows around the human body. As an example, the flow inside two specific intracranial aneurysms is modeled by generating CFD grids from 3D rotational angiography images. Specific issues of modeling, such as boundary conditions and location of flow inlets and outlets, in relation to the reconstructed geometry are discussed. The reconstructed arterial geometry including the aneurysm matches the visual representation generated by the angiogram software (Leonardo software). The calculated CFD flow patterns also show a good correlation to the flow visualization presented by the Leonardo software. Areas of high pressure and wall shear stress are identified. The same technique is also used to generate the CFD grid of a human trachea to study the particle dispersion patterns during a human cough cycle. The fluid is modeled using an actual human cough signal with the particles simulating the influenza virus. The flow pattern out of the mouth along with the dispersion pattern of the particles is validated against similar human experimental studies to track the spread of the disease through cough. Work is also currently underway to use the present grid generation program to construct a superficial mesh of the human body from MRI/CAT scan images of cadavers. The goal is to build an accurate and scalable model of the human body surface with articulate joints which can be posed in any environment to model the air flow patterns around the body.},

In the present paper we give a short review of the requirements for such simulations. First we discuss so-called direct numerical simulation (DNS), where the equations of motion for a turbulent flow are solved in all detail. This application is illustrated with two examples, viz. the transition from laminar to turbulence in a differential heated cavity and a fully developed turbulent pipe flow. The second application of turbulence simulation is large-eddy modelling where only the large scales of turbulence are numerically resolved and the small scales are parameterized by a turbulence model. As example for this case we discuss the atmospheric boundary layer and in particular the dispersion of pollutants by atmospheric turbulence. We close our contribution with a discussion of the computer requirements necessary for turbulence simulation together with an outlook in the future in which we consider the pro's and contra's of massively parallel systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Microbial pathogens of respiratory infectious diseases are often transmitted through particles in sneeze and cough. Therefore, understanding the particle movement is important for infection control. Images of a sneeze induced by nasal cavity stimulation by healthy adult volunteers, were taken by a digital high-vision, high-speed video system equipped with a computer system and treated as a research model. The obtained images were enhanced electronically, converted to digital images every 1/300 s, and subjected to vector analysis of the bioparticles contained in the whole sneeze cloud using automatic image processing software. The initial velocity of the particles or their clusters in the sneeze was greater than 6 m/s, but decreased as the particles moved forward; the momentums of the particles seemed to be lost by 0.15â€“0.20 s and started a diffusion movement. An approximate equation of a function of elapsed time for their velocity was obtained from the vector analysis to represent the dynamics of the front-line particles. This methodology was also applied for a cough. Microclouds contained in a smoke exhaled with a voluntary cough by a volunteer after smoking one breath of cigarette, were traced as the visible, aerodynamic surrogates for invisible bioparticles of cough. The smoke cough microclouds had an initial velocity greater than 5 m/s. The fastest microclouds were located at the forefront of cloud mass that moving forward; however, their velocity clearly decreased after 0.05 s and they began to diffuse in the environmental airflow. The maximum direct reaches of the particles and microclouds driven by sneezing and coughing unaffected by environmental airflows were estimated by calculations using the obtained equations to be about 84 cm and 30 cm from the mouth, respectively, both achieved in about 0.2 s, suggesting that data relating to the dynamics of sneeze and cough became available by calculation.},

The results presented demonstrate that the artificial compressibility based CBS scheme is suitable for both steady and unsteady state incompressible turbulent flow calculations at moderate Reynolds numbers.},

  Abstract                 = {The installation of upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) devices in ventilated rooms has the potential to reduce transmission of infections by an airborne route. However, the performance of such devices is dependant on several factors including the location of the lamp and the ventilation airflow in the room. This study uses a CFD model to evaluate the performance of UVGI devices by considering the cumulative UV-C dose received by the bulk room air in a ventilated room. By evaluating the UV dose rather than the resulting micro-organism inactivation the methodology can be used to optimise UVGI systems at the design stage, particularly when the source location of bioaerosol contaminants is not known. The study investigates the relationships between the lamp location, lamp power, ventilation system and room heating in a small, ventilated room. The results show that with ventilation air supplied at low level and extracted at high level the UVGI system performs better than with the air supplied at high level and extracted close to the floor. In addition the results show the presence of a heater in the room is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on performance and may promote mixing to increase the extent of disinfection.},

  Abstract                 = {Ventilator-induced lung injury has been proposed as being caused by overdistention and closure and reopening of small airways and alveoli. Here we investigate the possibility that heterogeneous constriction increases airflow-related shear stress to a dangerously high level that may be sufficient to cause injury to the epithelial cells during mechanical ventilation. We employed an anatomically consistent model of the respiratory system, based on Horsfield morphometric data, and solved for the time evolution of pressure and flow along the airway tree during mechanical ventilation. We simulated constant-flow ventilation with passive expiration in two different conditions: baseline and highly heterogeneous constriction. The constriction was applied with two strategies: establishing a simple diameter reduction or adding also a length shortening. The shear stress distribution on airway walls was analyzed for airways ranging from the trachea to the acini. Our results indicate that 1) heterogeneous constriction can amplify the maximal values of shear stress up to 50-fold, with peak values higher than 0.6 cmH2O; 2) the highest shear stress is found in pathways constricted by 60-80%; 3) simultaneous diameter reduction and shortening amplifies the shear stresses by three- to fourfold, with shear stresses reaching 2 cmH2O; and 4) there is a range of airways (diameters from 0.6 to 0.3 mm at baseline) that appear to be at risk of very high stresses. We conclude that elevated airflow-related shear stress on the epithelial cell layer can occur during heterogeneous constriction and conjecture that this may constitute a mechanism contributing to ventilator-induced lung injury.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction and Objectives: Recent epidemiological studies have shown an association between increased particulate urban air pollution and adverse health effects on susceptible parts of the population, in particular the elderly with pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Urban particles consist of three modes: ultrafine particles, accumulation mode particles (which together form the fine particle mode) and coarse mode particles. Ultrafine particles (those of &lt;0.1â€‰Î¼m diameter) contribute very little to the overall mass, but are very high in number, which in episodic events can reach several hundred thousand/cm3 in the urban air. The hypothesis that ultrafine particles are causally involved in adverse responses seen in sensitive humans is based on several studies summarized in this brief review. Methods and Results: Studies on rodents demonstrate that ultrafine particles administered to the lung cause a greater inflammatory response than do larger particles, per given mass. Surface properties (surface chemistry) appear to play an important role in ultrafine particle toxicity. Contributing to the effects of ultrafine particles is their very high size-specific deposition when inhaled as singlet ultrafine particles rather than as aggregated particles. It appears also that ultrafine particles, after deposition in the lung, largely escape alveolar macrophage surveillance and gain access to the pulmonary interstitium. Inhaled low doses of carbonaceous ultrafine particles can cause mild pulmonary inflammation in rodents after exposure for 6â€‰h. Old age and a compromised/sensitized respiratory tract in rodents can increase their susceptibility to the inflammatory effects of ultrafine particles significantly, and it appears that the aged organism is at a higher risk of oxidative stress induced lung injury from these particles, compared with the young organism. Results also show that ultrafine particle effects can be significantly enhanced by a gaseous co-pollutant such as ozone. Conclusions: The studies performed so far support the ultrafine particle hypothesis. Additional studies are necessary to evaluate mechanistic pathways of responses.},

  Abstract                 = {Nanotechnology, nanomedicine and nanotoxicology are complementary disciplines aimed at the betterment of human life. However, concerns have been expressed about risks posed by engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), their potential to cause undesirable effects, contaminate the environment and adversely affect susceptible parts of the population. Information about toxicity and biokinetics of nano-enabled products combined with the knowledge of unintentional human and environmental exposure or intentional delivery for medicinal purposes will be necessary to determine real or perceived risks of nanomaterials. Yet, results of toxicological studies using only extraordinarily high experimental doses have to be interpreted with caution. Key concepts of nanotoxicology are addressed, including significance of dose, dose rate, and biokinetics, which are exemplified by specific findings of ENM toxicity, and by discussing the importance of detailed physico-chemical characterization of nanoparticles, specifically surface properties. Thorough evaluation of desirable versus adverse effects is required for safe applications of ENMs, and major challenges lie ahead to answer key questions of nanotoxicology. Foremost are assessment of human and environmental exposure, and biokinetics or pharmacokinetics, identification of potential hazards, and biopersistence in cells and subcellular structures to perform meaningful risk assessments. A specific example of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) illustrates the difficulty of extrapolating toxicological results. MWCNT were found to cause asbestos-like effects of the mesothelium following intracavitary injection of high doses in rodents. The important question of whether inhaled MWCNT will translocate to sensitive mesothelial sites has not been answered yet. Even without being able to perform a quantitative risk assessment for ENMs, due to the lack of sufficient data on exposure, biokinetics and organ toxicity, until we know better it should be made mandatory to prevent exposure by appropriate precautionary measures/regulations and practicing best industrial hygiene to avoid future horror scenarios from environmental or occupational exposures. Similarly, safety assessment for medical applications as key contribution of nanotoxicology to nanomedicine relies heavily on nano-specific toxicological concepts and findings and on a multidisciplinary collaborative approach involving material scientists, physicians and toxicologists.},

  Abstract                 = {A continuum-based elastic micromechanics model is developed for silica nanoparticle/polyimide composites with various nanoparticle/polyimide interfacial treatments. The model incorporates the molecular structures of the nanoparticle, polyimide, and interfacial regions, which are determined using a molecular modeling method that involves coarse-grained and reverse-mapping techniques. The micromechanics model includes an effective interface between the polyimide and nanoparticle with properties and dimensions that are determined using the results of molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that the model can be used to predict the elastic properties of silica nanoparticle/polyimide composites for a large range of nanoparticle radii, 10-10,000Â A. For silica nanoparticle radii above 1000Â A, the predicted properties are equal to those predicted using the standard Mori-Tanaka micromechanical approach, which does not incorporate the molecular structure. It is also shown that the specific silica nanoparticle/polyimide interface conditions have a significant effect on the composite mechanical properties for nanoparticle radii below 1000Â A.},

  Abstract                 = {A wind tunnel study of the flow behind a two-dimensional model fence placed perpendicular to the wind was conducted in the NIES Atmospheric Diffusion Simulation Wind Tunnel. Two inflow conditions were studied for their effects on the nondimensionalized cavity wake length, : surface roughness (Returb [similar, equals] 15 to 62) and thermal stratification (Ri [similar, equals] -0.20 to +0.23). It was found that as Returb increases, increases. In the unstable region, decreases only slightly as Ri decreases (from 13.0 in neutral conditions to ~12.5 for strong unstable); however, in the stable region, decreases drastically as the stability increases (to ~7.0 for strongly stable). Similar tendencies were found in a related field study (Ogawa and Diosey, 1980) and a comparison of both sets of data in order to determine proper similarity criteria showed that: 1. (1) as a practical choice, the equality of turbulent intensities may be the appropriate similarity criterion for this type of flow; 2. (2) when using over-sized roughness (roughness large relative to model height) to achieve similar flow behind the model, better agreement for the oncoming mean velocity profile was found with the inclusion of a zero-plane displacement factor assumed equal to the roughness element height; and 3. (3) using over-sized roughness for the purpose of simulating the large u-component eddy size found in the atmosphere can lead to an over-sized w-component scale of eddies in the wind tunnel.},

  Abstract                 = {A mobile whole-body exposure system was developed for exposing mice to concentrated ambient particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microm in mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD). Each 20-L exposure cage was designed to hold 9 mice within individual compartments. This allowed for transport and subsequent exposure. Airflow mixing and the potential for stagnant areas within the compartments were modeled using computational fluid dynamic modeling (CFD). CFD analysis showed no stagnant areas and good mixing throughout the exposure cage. The actual performance of the exposure system was determined for 0.5 to 2.0 microm diameter aerosols by measuring (1) uniformity of aerosol distribution and (2) particle deposition in the tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions of mice exposed in the system. A 0.6-microm MMAD (GSD=2.0) cigarette smoke aerosol was used to experimentally measure the uniformity of aerosol distribution to the nine individual compartments. The average data from three runs showed no statistically significant difference among individual compartments. Particle deposition efficiency in adult male BALB/c mice was measured after exposure (30 min) in the system using monodisperse fluorescent polystyrene latex particles (0.5, 1, and 2 microm aerodynamic diameter). The measured deposition efficiency in this mobile exposure system for the combined tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions of the adult male BALBc mice was 21% for 0.5 microm, 11% for 1.0 microm, and 6.5% for 2.0 microm particles. These deposition efficiencies are similar to those reported for mice exposed in a nose-only exposure system, which indicates that particle losses to animal fur and exposure system surfaces were acceptable.},

An experimental investigation has been carried out to determine statistically the optimum build parameters to be used in the Taguchi method, to improve the SLA product quality. The two new hatch styles developed in this study have resulted in an overall improvement of the part accuracy, and a new layer thickness for part building in stereolithography has been proposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;},

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional simulations of the transport and uptake of a reactive gas such as O3 were compared between an idealized model of the larynx, trachea, and first bifurcation and a second "control" model in which the larynx was replaced by an equivalent, cylindrical, tube segment. The Navier-Stokes equations, Spalart-Allmaras turbulence equation, and convection-diffusion equation were implemented at conditions reflecting inhalation into an adult human lung. Simulation results were used to analyze axial velocity, turbulent viscosity, local fractional uptake, and regional uptake. Axial velocity data revealed a strong laryngeal jet with a reattachment point in the proximal trachea. Turbulent viscosity data indicated that jet turbulence occurred only at high Reynolds numbers and was attenuated by the first bifurcation. Local fractional uptake data affirmed hotspots previously reported at the first carina, and suggested additional hotspots at the glottal constriction and jet reattachment point in the proximal trachea. These laryngeal effects strongly depended on inlet Reynolds number, with maximal effects (approaching 15%) occurring at maximal inlet flow rates. While the increase in the regional uptake caused by the larynx subsided by the end of the model, the effect of the larynx on cumulative uptake persisted further downstream. These results suggest that with prolonged exposure to a reactive gas, entire regions of the larynx and proximal trachea could show signs of tissue injury.},

For [tau]+>10 ( for Re=9894) there was little difference between the turbulence models. Simulations for both Re=9894 and 50,000 were carried out and good performance was seen for both. The effect of drag model was assessed and resulted in little difference in predicted deposition velocity. The influence of grid resolution was also investigated and it was seen that the cell centre of the wall-adjacent cell should be at a distance of y+=2 or less for quantitative prediction of deposition. Coarser grids resulted in over-prediction for low [tau]+.},

Active anterior rhinomanometry allows reliable assessment of the nasal respiratory function, acoustic rhinometry shows the geometry of nasal cavity, mucociliary transport time is an indicator of the mucosa eutrophism. In our experience, the specific nasal provocation test is one of the most important tests in this field. It is more sensitive than the skin test and the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) in the asymptomatic phase and it is able to show organ allergies.

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Malignant tumours arising within the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are rare and composed of several histological types, rendering controlled clinical trials to establish the best treatment impractical. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the clinical outcomes of patients treated with charged particle therapy with those of individuals receiving photon therapy.; METHODS: We identified studies of nasal cavity and paranasal sinus tumours through searches of databases including Embase, Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration. We included treatment-naive cohorts (both primary and adjuvant radiation therapy) and those with recurrent disease. Primary outcomes of interest were overall survival, disease-free survival, and locoregional control, at 5 years and at longest follow-up. We used random-effect models to pool outcomes across studies and compared event rates of combined outcomes for charged particle therapy and photon therapy using an interaction test.; FINDINGS: 43 cohorts from 41 non-comparative observational studies were included. Median follow-up for the charged particle therapy group was 38 months (range 5-73) and for the photon therapy group was 40 months (14-97). Pooled overall survival was significantly higher at 5 years for charged particle therapy than for photon therapy (relative risk 1Â·51, 95% CI 1Â·14-1Â·99; p=0Â·0038) and at longest follow-up (1Â·27, 1Â·01-1Â·59; p=0Â·037). At 5 years, disease-free survival was significantly higher for charged particle therapy than for photon therapy (1Â·93, 1Â·36-2Â·75, p=0Â·0003) but, at longest follow-up, this event rate did not differ between groups (1Â·51, 1Â·00-2Â·30; p=0Â·052). Locoregional control did not differ between treatment groups at 5 years (1Â·06, 0Â·68-1Â·67; p=0Â·79) but it was higher for charged particle therapy than for photon therapy at longest follow-up (1Â·18, 1Â·01-1Â·37; p=0Â·031). A subgroup analysis comparing proton beam therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy showed significantly higher disease-free survival at 5 years (relative risk 1Â·44, 95% CI 1Â·01-2Â·05; p=0Â·045) and locoregional control at longest follow-up (1Â·26, 1Â·05-1Â·51; p=0Â·011).; INTERPRETATION: Compared with photon therapy, charged particle therapy could be associated with better outcomes for patients with malignant diseases of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Prospective studies emphasising collection of patient-reported and functional outcomes are strongly encouraged.; FUNDING: Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

  Abstract                 = {Exposure to ultrafine particles poses a potential health risk to school children. While many studies have focused on measuring ultrafine particle (UFP) concentrations in environments where children are at risk of high exposure, few studies have examined the particle deposition in the respiratory tract of children. This study aims to examine the particle deposition in the respiratory tract of school children in different microenvironments. UFP size distribution data were collected in residential homes, school buses, school classrooms, and from school outdoor air in both rural and urban areas of South Texas. The size distribution data were input to the Multiple Path Particle Dosimetry model to calculate regional and total particle deposition fraction. A 24-hour-school-day exposure was simulated by adding the time children spend in each microenvironment. The maximum pulmonary deposition fraction occurs at a diameter ranging from 18 to 40 nm, depending on condition. Age mostly affected the pulmonary region and the total lung deposition with the highest deposition fraction observed for younger children. In addition, comparison of size-dependent regional deposition and particle concentration establishes an accurate depiction of children's exposure and dose profiles. While children only spend 4% of the day in the home source environment, that environment may account for up to 77% of total daily dose intake. Higher deposition fraction occurs at smaller particle size. Younger children show increased levels of particle deposition than older children. Exposure period does not correlate to daily percentage of dose intake. This research can be used to assess children's accumulative exposure to UFPs.},

  Abstract                 = {Context Health risks of fine particulate matter of 2.5 {micro}m or less in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) have been studied extensively over the last decade. Evidence concerning the health risks of the coarse fraction of greater than 2.5 {micro}m and 10 {micro}m or less in aerodynamic diameter (PM10-2.5) is limited. Objective To estimate risk of hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases associated with PM10-2.5 exposure, controlling for PM2.5. Design, Setting, and Participants Using a database assembled for 108 US counties with daily cardiovascular and respiratory disease admission rates, temperature and dew-point temperature, and PM10-2.5 and PM2.5 concentrations were calculated with monitoring data as an exposure surrogate from January 1, 1999, through December 31, 2005. Admission rates were constructed from the Medicare National Claims History Files, for a study population of approximately 12 million Medicare enrollees living on average 9 miles (14.4 km) from collocated pairs of PM10 and PM2.5 monitors. Main Outcome Measures Daily counts of county-wide emergency hospital admissions for primary diagnoses of cardiovascular or respiratory disease. Results There were 3.7 million cardiovascular disease and 1.4 million respiratory disease admissions. A 10-{micro}g/m3 increase in PM10-2.5 was associated with a 0.36% (95% posterior interval [PI], 0.05% to 0.68%) increase in cardiovascular disease admissions on the same day. However, when adjusted for PM2.5, the association was no longer statistically significant (0.25%; 95% PI, -0.11% to 0.60%). A 10-{micro}g/m3 increase in PM10-2.5 was associated with a nonstatistically significant unadjusted 0.33% (95% PI, -0.21% to 0.86%) increase in respiratory disease admissions and with a 0.26% (95% PI, -0.32% to 0.84%) increase in respiratory disease admissions when adjusted for PM2.5. The unadjusted associations of PM2.5 with cardiovascular and respiratory disease admissions were 0.71% (95% PI, 0.45%-0.96%) for same-day exposure and 0.44% (95% PI, 0.06% to 0.82%) for exposure 2 days before hospital admission. Conclusion After adjustment for PM2.5, there were no statistically significant associations between coarse particulates and hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {A modified Blalock-Taussig shunt is a connection created between the systemic and pulmonary arterial circulations to improve pulmonary perfusion in children with congenital heart diseases. Survival of these patients is critically dependent on blood flow distribution between the pulmonary and systemic circulations which in turn depends upon the flow resistance of the shunt. Previously, we investigated the pressure-flow relationship in rigid shunts with a computational approach, to estimate the pulmonary blood flow rate on the basis of the in vivo measured pressure drop. The present study aims at evaluating in vitro how the anastomotic distensibility and restrictions due to suture presence affect the shunt pressure-flow relationship. Two actual Gore-TexÂ® shunts (3 and 4Â mm diameters) were sutured to compliant conduits by a surgeon and tested at different steady flow rates (0.25-1Â lÂ min-1) and pulmonary pressures (3-34Â mmHg). Corresponding computational models were also created to investigate the role of the anastomotic restrictions due to sutures. In vitro experiments showed that pulmonary artery pressure affects the pressure-flow relationship of the anastomoses, particularly at the distal site. However, this occurrence scarcely influences the total shunt pressure drop. Comparisons between in vitro and computational models without anastomotic restrictions show that the latter underestimates the in vitro pressure drops at any flow rate. The addition of the anastomotic restrictions (31 and 47% of the original area of 3 and 4Â mm shunts, respectively) to the computational models reduces the gap, especially at high shunt flow rate and high pulmonary pressure.},

  Abstract                 = {The dissipation of kinetic energy is one of the key features of turbulent flows that must be modeled accurately in order to obtain useful engineering predictions. At high Reynolds numbers the assumption of scale separation can be invoked in the modeling of the dissipation process. This paper focuses on the more difficult issue of modeling the dissipation process at moderate and low Reynolds numbers. The low and moderate Reynolds number range is very important for tuning turbulence models and for many practical engineering problems. To approach this problem, an alternative formulation to the classic dissipation scale equation is proposed. The interesting feature of this formulation, an inverse lengthscale equation, is that it captures both the high Reynolds number and low Reynolds number decay limits. A careful assessment of existing data then allows us to clearly identify the region of transition between high and low Re and propose a very simple equation system which can accurately model dissipation at any Reynolds number. The equivalent <i>K</i>/ÃŽÂµ model is derived and the proposed model is compared with a number of other low Re dissipation modifications for the <i>K</i>/ÃŽÂµ equation system. To complete the discussion, the issue of near-wall dissipation modeling is carefully examined and shown to be fundamentally different from the low Reynolds number limit. This is shown to be an important distinction of practical modeling importance.},

  Abstract                 = {A study of particle deposition in industrial duct bends is presented. Particle deposition by size was measured by comparing particle size distributions upstream and downstream of bends that had geometries and flow conditions similar to those used in industrial ventilation. As the interior surface of the duct bend was greased to prevent particle bounce, the results are applicable to liquid drops and solid particles where duct walls are sticky. Factors investigated were: (i) flow Reynolds number (Re = 203 000, 36 000); (ii) particle Reynolds number (10 < Rep{infty} < 200); (iii) particle Stokes number (0.08 < Stk < 16); (iv) bend angle ({theta} = 45{degrees}, 90{degrees}, 180{degrees}); (v) bend curvature ratio (1.7 < R0 < 12); (vi) orientation (horizontal-to-horizontal and horizontal-tovertical); and (vii) construction technique (smooth, gored, segmented). Measured deposition was compared with models developed for bends in small diameter sampling lines (Re < 20 000; Rep{infty} < 13). Whereas deposition measured in this work generally agreed with that estimated with models for particles <30 {micro}m (Stk < 0.7), it was significantly lower than that estimated for larger particles. As the flow around larger particles became increasingly turbulent, the models progressively under-represented drag forces and over-estimated deposition. For particles >20 {micro}m, deposition was slightly greater in the horizontal-to-horizontal orientation than in the horizontal-to-vertical orientation due to gravitational settling. Penetration was not a multiplicative function of bend angle as theory predicts, due to the developing nature of turbulent flow in bends. Deposition in a smooth bend was similar to that in a gored bend; however, a tight radius segmented bend (R0 = 1.7) exhibited much lower deposition. For more gradual bends (3 < R0 < 12), curvature ratio had negligible effect on deposition.},

The presented study investigated cooling of the expiratory air for heat recovery within the human nose applying numerical simulation. A numerical simulation in a bilateral three-dimensional model of the human nose based on computed tomography was employed. Temperature distribution and airflow patterns during expiration were displayed. Cooling of the expiratory air primarily takes place in the areas of inferior and middle turbinate. Areas of the highest decrease in temperature are characterized by turbulent airflow with vortices of low velocity. Numerical results showed good concordance with experimental inÂ vivo temperature measurements. Heating of inspired air not only depends on inspiration but also on expiration. Cooling the warm expiratory air may be regarded as an important factor for heat recovery. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the close relation between heat exchange and airflow patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {The present work examines the turbulent flow in an enclosed rotor-stator system subjected to heat transfer effects. Besides their fundamental importance as three-dimensional prototype flows, such flows arise in many industrial applications but also in many geophysical and astrophysical settings. Large eddy simulations (LES) are here performed using a spectral vanishing viscosity technique. The LES results have already been favorably compared to velocity measurements in the isothermal case (SÃ©verac, E., Poncet, S., Serre, E., Chauve, M.P., 2007. Large eddy simulation and measurements of turbulent enclosed rotor-stator flows. Phys. Fluids, 19, 085113) for a large range of Reynolds numbers 105[less-than-or-equals, slant]Re=[Omega]b2/[nu][less-than-or-equals, slant]106, in an annular cavity of large aspect ratio G=(b-a)/H=5 and weak curvature parameter Rm=(b-a)/(b+a)=1.8 (a,b the inner and outer radii of the rotor and H the interdisk spacing). The purpose of this paper is to extend these previous results in the non-isothermal case using the Boussinesq approximation to take into account the buoyancy effects. Thus, the effects of thermal convection have been examined for a turbulent flow Re=106 of air in the same rotor-stator system for Rayleigh numbers up to Ra=108. These LES results provide accurate, instantaneous quantities which are of interest in understanding the physics of turbulent flows and heat transfers in an interdisk cavity. Even at high Rayleigh numbers, the structure of the iso-values of the instantaneous normal temperature gradient at the disk surfaces resembles the one of the iso-values of the tangential velocity with large spiral arms along the rotor and more thin structures along the stator. The averaged results show small effects of density variation on the mean and turbulent fields. The turbulent Prandtl number is a decreasing function of the distance to the wall with 1.4 close to the disks and about 0.3 in the outer layers. The local Nusselt number is found to be proportional to the local Reynolds number to the power 0.7. The evolution of the averaged Bolgiano length scale <LB> with the Rayleigh number indicates that temperature fluctuations may have a large influence on the dynamics only at the largest scales of the system for Ra[greater-or-equal, slanted]107, since <LB> remains lower than the thermal boundary layer thicknesses.},

The main objectives of this research are to know more about the structure of turbulent flows, to identify their three-dimensional characteristic and to study physical effects due to heat transfer. The filtered Navier-Stokes equations are used to simulate large scales, however they are supplemented by subgrid-scale (SGS) models to simulate the energy transfer from large scales toward subgrid-scales, where this energy will be dissipated by molecular viscosity. Two SGS models are applied: the classical Smagorinsky's model and the Dynamic model for large eddy simulation (LES). Both models are implemented in a three-dimensional finite element code using linear tetrahedral elements. Qualitative and quantitative aspects of two and three-dimensional flows in a lid-driven cavity and over a backward-facing step, using LES, are analyzed comparing numerical and experimental results obtained by other authors.},

Results indicated that powders containing 5% (w/w) of leucine, proline or histidine and dried from 3:7 ethanol/water feeds showed very satisfying aerodynamic properties with fine particle fractionÂ >Â 60%. Both neat N (raw and spray-dried) and N-leu1 dry-powder showing good aerodynamic properties were tested in cystic fibrosis (CF) and normal bronchial epithelial cells. Cell proliferation and expression levels of the key enzymes of the NF-[kappa]B and MAPK/ERK pathways, overactivated in CF cell lines, were evaluated. N-leu1 was able to significantly inhibit the expression levels of IKK[alpha], IKK[beta], as well as of the direct NF-[kappa]B inhibitor, I[kappa]B[alpha]. In addition N-Leu1 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinase and did not reduce cell proliferation as observed for the neat raw drug. Leucine co-spray-dried with the drug improved both aerodynamic properties and in vitro pharmacological activity of Naringin. The optimized N-Leu formulation as dry powder is potentially able to reduce hyperinflammatory status associated to CF.},

Bends constructed of stainless steel and glass tubes of different diameters were used. The experiments were performed using monodisperse aerosols generated by the vibrating orifice aerosol generator. The results were in good agreement with the theory of Cheng and Wang for <i>Re</i> = 1000, but differed from theory for <i>Re</i> = 100. For the turbulent cases, no dependence was found on the flow Reynolds number and an exponential curve of deposition efficiency versus Stokes number was fitted to the experimental results.

  Abstract                 = {This study deals with a numerical solution of a 2D unsteady flow of a compressible viscous fluid in a channel for low inlet airflow velocity. The unsteadiness of the flow is caused by a prescribed periodic motion of a part of the channel wall with large amplitudes, nearly closing the channel during oscillations. The channel is a simplified model of the glottal space in the human vocal tract and the flow can represent a model of airflow coming from the trachea, through the glottal region with periodically vibrating vocal folds, and to the human vocal tract. The flow is described by a system of Navier-Stokes equations for laminar flows. The numerical solution is implemented using the finite volume method (FVM) and the predictor-corrector MacCormack scheme with Jameson artificial viscosity using a grid of quadrilateral cells. Due to the unsteadiness of the grid (motion of the grid), the basic system of conservation laws is considered in a changed form using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method. The numerical solution has been carried out for a symmetric and a non-symmetric flow field in two computational domains. The numerical results for unsteady flows in the channel are presented for inlet Mach number M[infinity]=0.012, Reynolds number Re=5Ã—103 and wall motion frequency 100Â Hz. The authors present the numerical solution and simulations of flow fields in the channel, acquired from a program that has been developed exclusively for this purpose. The reason for using a numerical simulation was the lack of data from experimental results of flows through the glottal region, and the capability of such simulation to model the problem.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;All dust control measures are necessary to reduce dust exposure in MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard)-milling, because of the high amount and fineness of the dust produced and a&nbsp;potential risk of exposure to formaldehyde or other glue chemicals during the machining of MDF. The most effective way of reducing dust exposure is to reduce the emission of dust at the source. Airborne dust emission was studied and modelled in the milling. In the milling of MDF, airborne dust emission was much higher than in the milling of solid materials. Milling of MDF produced airborne particles with a&nbsp;mass median diameter of 6â€“7&nbsp;Âµm. The most significant factor affecting the amount of dust created from milling was average chip thickness. In order to reduce the amount of dust, milling parameters should be chosen so that the average chip thickness is greater than 0.05&nbsp;mm. The average chip thickness could be obtained with different milling parameters, for example with different combinations of feed and traverse rates. The same chip thicknesses resulted in around the same percentage fraction of fine dust mass regardless of how the average chip thickness was obtained. The relationship between the percentage fraction of fine dust mass from the removed mass (c%) and the chip thickness (hm) was modelled and presented in the form of c% = 0.194&nbsp;h m -1. The model developed can be used to estimate the percentage fraction of fine dust mass as a&nbsp;function of chip thickness. The model can be used in optimisation programs for CNC milling machines to minimize the airborne dust generated and to reduce dust exposure.},

  Abstract                 = {Polydispersed particles in reactive flows is a wide subject area encompassing a range of dispersed flows with particles, droplets or bubbles that are created, transported and possibly interact within a reactive flow environment - typical examples include soot formation, aerosols, precipitation and spray combustion. One way to treat such problems is to employ as a starting point the Newtonian equations of motion written in a Lagrangian framework for each individual particle and either solve them directly or derive probabilistic equations for the particle positions (in the case of turbulent flow). Another way is inherently statistical and begins by postulating a distribution of particles over the distributed properties, as well as space and time, the transport equation for this distribution being the core of this approach. This transport equation, usually referred to as population balance equation (PBE) or general dynamic equation (GDE), was initially developed and investigated mainly in the context of spatially homogeneous systems. In the recent years, a growth of research activity has seen this approach being applied to a variety of flow problems such as sooting flames and turbulent precipitation, but significant issues regarding its appropriate coupling with CFD pertain, especially in the case of turbulent flow. The objective of this review is to examine this body of research from a unified perspective, the potential and limits of the PBE approach to flow problems, its links with Lagrangian and multi-fluid approaches and the numerical methods employed for its solution. Particular emphasis is given to turbulent flows, where the extension of the PBE approach is met with challenging issues. Finally, applications including reactive precipitation, soot formation, nanoparticle synthesis, sprays, bubbles and coal burning are being reviewed from the PBE perspective. It is shown that population balance methods have been applied to these fields in varying degrees of detail, and future prospects are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this article is to summarize a computational approach, which developed and matured over an extended period of time, and has been shown to be useful for performing large-eddy simulation (LES) of flows with active control. Because of the nature of active flow control, simulation of this class of problems typically cannot be carried out accurately by methods less sophisticated than LES. Active control flowfields are highly unsteady, and can be characterized by small-scale fluid structures which are produced by the control process, but may also be inherent in the original uncontrolled situation. The numerical scheme is predicated upon an implicit time-marching algorithm, and utilizes a high-order compact finite-difference approximation to represent spatial derivatives. Robustness of the scheme is maintained by employing a low-pass Pade-type nondispersive spatial filter, which also accounts for the fine-scale turbulent dissipation that otherwise is traditionally provided by an explicitly added subgrid-scale (SGS) stress model. Geometrically complex applications are accommodated by an overset grid technique, where spatial accuracy is preserved through use of high-order interpolation. Utility of the method is illustrated by specific computational examples, including suppression of acoustic resonance in supersonic cavity flow, leading-edge vortex control of a delta wing, efficiency enhancement of a transitional highly loaded low-pressure turbine blade, and separation control of a wall-mounted hump model. Control techniques represented in these examples are comprised of both steady and pulsed mass injection or removal, as well as plasma-based actuation. For each case, features of the flowfield are elucidated and the solutions are compared to the baseline situation where no control was enforced. Where available, comparisons are also made with experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {A better understanding of submicron particle deposition in the respiratory tract is needed to study the health effects caused by carcinogenic particles. Recent studies indicate that random diffusion is not sufficient to describe the motion of these particles in complex geometries, rendering conventional models inaccurate. A solid replica of excised human lung segments was used to create digital and hollow models of the tracheobronchial region to investigate deposition of mainstream (MS) and sidestream (SS) cigarette smoke particles. Particle sizes for the carcinogen Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) in SS smoke, and total particulate matter (UVPM) in SS and MS smoke were measured and used to compare the simulation to experimental data. Excellent agreement was found between predicted and measured results. Random diffusion was not found to be significant for submicron particles indicating that particles were instead transported to the airway wall by convective diffusion. BaP in SS smoke was an average 0.3&nbsp;Î¼m compared to 0.36&nbsp;Î¼m for UVPM in SS smoke. The trends in both experimental and numerical results indicated that the BaP in SS smoke deposits at a slightly higher efficiency than the UVPM, indicating that carcinogen-specific deposition, rather than total particulate matter should be considered when investigating health effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and magnetic resonance (MR) gas velocimetry were concurrently performed to study airflow in the same model of human proximal airways. Realistic in vivo-based human airway geometry was segmented from thoracic computed tomography. The three-dimensional numerical description of the airways was used for both generation of a physical airway model using rapid prototyping and mesh generation for CFD simulations. Steady laminar inspiratory experiments (Reynolds number Re = 770) were performed and velocity maps down to the fourth airway generation were extracted from a new velocity mapping technique based on MR velocimetry using hyperpolarized 3He gas. Full two-dimensional maps of the velocity vector were measured within a few seconds. Numerical simulations were carried out with the experimental flow conditions, and the two sets of data were compared between the two modalities. Flow distributions agreed within 3%. Main and secondary flow velocity intensities were similar, as were velocity convective patterns. This work demonstrates that experimental and numerical gas velocity data can be obtained and compared in the same complex airway geometry. Experiments validated the simulation platform that integrates patient-specific airway reconstruction process from in vivo thoracic scans and velocity field calculation with CFD, hence allowing the results of this numerical tool to be used with confidence in potential clinical applications for lung characterization. Finally, this combined numerical and experimental approach of flow assessment in realistic in vivo-based human airway geometries confirmed the strong dependence of airway flow patterns on local and global geometrical factors, which could contribute to gas mixing.},

  Abstract                 = {Goals To give an overview on the theoretical and practical applications of chemosensory event-related potentials.Methods Chemosensory event-related potentials (ERPs) may be elicited by brief and precisely defined odorous stimuli. Based on the principles of air-dilution olfactometry, a stimulator was developed in the late 1970s, which allows stimulation of the olfactory neuroepithelium and the nasal mucosa with no concomitant mechanical stimulation. Chemosensory ERPs were obtained after stimulation of the olfactory nerve (olfactory ERPs) or the trigeminal nerve (somatosensory or trigeminal ERPs). The characteristics of the stimulator for chemosensory research as well as the variables influencing the responses are discussed in this paper.Results Implementation and normative data from our department are reported with different clinical examples from otorhinolaryngologic clinic. The bulk of the evoked response consists of a large negative component (often referred to as N1), which occurs between 320 and 450Â ms after stimulus onset. This component is followed by a large positive component, often referred to as P2, occurring between 530 and 800Â ms after stimulus onset. Absence of olfactory ERPs and presence (even with subtle changes) of somatosensory ERPs is a strong indicator of the presence of an olfactory dysfunction.Conclusions This review examines and discusses the methods of chemosensory stimulation as well as the electrophysiological correlates elicited by such stimuli. The clinical applications of chemosensory ERPs in neurology and otorhinolaryngology are outlined.},

  Abstract                 = {A numerical simulation model was developed to predict the instantaneous concentration fluctuation of a plume and applied to stack-gas diffusion around a cubical building. The flow field, including an instantaneous velocity component, was predicted using the large eddy simulation (LES) method in the developed numerical model. Then, the instantaneous concentration fluctuation was predicted using the obtained unsteady flow field. Concentration was calculated using the finite difference method, in which the LES is expanded for concentration, and the puff method, in which small volumes of the tracer gas are divided and combined according to the calculation mesh sizes. In order to avoid numerical viscous effects, a puff method and finite difference method were applied separately in the regions near and far from the stack-gas release point, respectively. Then, the flow field around a cubical building and the diffusion of stack-gas, emitted from an elevated point source at an upstream position of the building, were calculated using the model mentioned above. Numerical calculation results were compared with those obtained in wind tunnel experiments in which concentration fluctuation was measured using high-response flame ionization detectors. Although there were some discrepancies in the flow field between the calculated results and those of wind tunnel experiments, e.g., the calculated windward length of a cavity region behind the building, the calculated mean velocity and turbulent intensity showed good agreement with those of the wind tunnel experiments. Furthermore, the calculated concentration fluctuation showed good agreement with that in the wind tunnel, not only regarding the features of fluctuating concentration signals, but also statistic quantities, viz., mean concentration, fluctuation intensity and high-concentration values.},

The technique offers an advantage in terms of subjecting the analyte to very little mechanical stress compared to other methods. Secondly, these methods are non-laborious, cheap and often highly scalable. Moreover, techniques employing magnetism are more amenable to automation and miniaturization. Now that the human genome is sequenced and about 30,000 genes are annotated, the next step is to identify the function of these individual genes, carrying out genotyping studies for allelic variation and SNP analysis, ultimately leading to identification of novel drug targets. In this post-genomic era, technologies based on magnetic separation are becoming an integral part of todays biology laboratory. This article briefly reviews the selected applications of magnetic separation techniques in the field of biotechnology, biomedicine and drug discovery.},

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of aging on nasal tactile sensitivity. Methods: A total of 160 healthy patients aged between 50 and 90 years were included. According to their age, patients were divided into groups (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H). From the age of 50, each group included subjects with an age range of 5 years (i.e. group A, 50-55 years; group B, 56-60 years, etc.). Each patient's outcome was assessed through the nasal monofilament test: a set of 20 Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments was used to detect nasal sensitivity for both nasal cavities. The sensitivity threshold was recorded as the minimum monofilament size from which patients could detect at least two of three stimuli. Results: In groups D (66-70 years), E (71-75 years), F (76-80 years), G (81-85 years), and H (86-90 years) a significantly ( p < 0.05) higher s},

  Abstract                 = {This CFD modeling study examines the concentrations of two gaseous compounds that react in an indoor setting to produce a hypothetical product. The reactants are ozone and either d-limonene or [alpha]-terpinene (which reacts with ozone about 40 times faster than d-limonene). In addition to two different terpenes, the scenarios include two air exchange rates (0.5 and 2.0 h-1). The terpene is introduced as a floor source with an emission pattern similar to a floor-care product. These four scenarios have been set in a fairly large two-dimensional room (13.6Ã—40.6 m) with a supply at the top of the left wall and an exhaust at the bottom of the right wall. The room has been deliberately scaled so that the Reynolds numbers for key flow regimes match those of a room in which the calculated flow field has been validated against measured data. It has been further assumed that ozone interacts with room surfaces while the terpenes do not. The results show that for all four scenarios, under steady-state conditions, there are large concentration gradients within the room for both reactants and product. To some extent this is due to imperfect mixing. However, it also reflects that reactions occur at different rates across the room (because of varying reactant concentrations) and that the time available for reactions to occur varies with the room location (because the "age of the air" varies from point to point). Locally, within the room, the concentrations calculated by the CFD method differ significantly from those calculated by a one-compartment mass-balance model assuming perfect mixing.},

The passive dust monitor conversion models for equivalent concentrations of inhalable dust and total dust based on data from the present study were not significantly different from the original models. Therefore models based on all available data were used. The parameters of the distribution of equivalent concentration of inhalable dust were 0.94 mg/m3 (geometric mean) and 2.10 (geometric standard deviation). Compared with a national cross sectional study from 1988 the exposure level (geometric mean) was reduced by a factor 2.0. Inhalable dust exposure was about 50% higher than exposure measured by the Danish â€˜totalâ€™ dust method.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle deposition patterns were measured in the first five branching generations of replicate hollow casts made from a solid cast of a human tracheobronchial tree. The casts were exposed to radioactively tagged aerosols, having MMADs of approx. 3 and 8 {micro}m, under a series of constant and cyclic inspiratory flow patterns having equivalent mean flow rates. Deposition efficiencies at bifurcation and length subregions of each generation were greater under cyclic flow and these differences were greater for the smaller sized aerosol.},

  Abstract                 = {The slow migration of a small and solid particle in the vicinity of a gas-liquid, fluid-fluid or solid-fluid plane boundary when subject to a gravity or an external flow field is addressed. By contrast with previous works, the advocated approach holds for arbitrarily shaped particles and arbitrary external Stokes flow fields complying with the conditions on the boundary. It appeals to a few theoretically established and numerically solved boundary-integral equations on the particle's surface. This integral formulation of the problem allows us to provide asymptotic approximations for a distant boundary and also, implementing a boundary element technique, accurate numerical results for arbitrary locations of the boundary. The results obtained for spheroids, both settling or immersed in external pure shear and straining flows, reveal that the rigid-body motion experienced by a particle deeply depends upon its shape and also upon the boundary location and properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecogeographic variation in nasal valve angles stands as one of the best examples of human morphological adaptation to climate. A major physiological function of the nasal cavity is to condition the inhaled air to body core temperature and saturated with vapour to prevent damage to the alveolar epithelium in the lungs. The air conditioning capability of the nose is dependent on the nasal mucosal temperature and the airflow dynamics caused by the airway geometry. Morphological variation of the human nose has been attributed to the ecogeographic adaptation to climate where nasal cavities have been broadly categorised as tall and narrow (leptorrhines) or short and broad (platyrrhines) according to their morphology. We believe that there is a relationship between nasal valve angles and climate adaptation. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {A spectral vanishing viscosity technique (SVV) is presented for the simulation of 3D turbulent incompressible flows within a rotor-stator cavity. One characteristic of this technique is that the SVV is active only for the short length scales, a feature which is reminiscent of Large Eddy Simulation models. The Spectral Vanishing Viscosity, first introduced by E. Tadmor for the inviscid Burgers equation [E. Tadmor, Convergence of spectral methods for nonlinear conservation laws, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 26 (1) (1989) 30], is incorporated into the cylindrical Navier-Stokes equations written in velocity pressure formulation. The second-order operator involved in the SVV-method is implemented in a Chebyshev-collocation Fourier-Galerkin pseudo-spectral code. The SVV is shown to lead to stable discretizations without sacrificing the formal accuracy, i.e., exponential convergence, in the proposed discretization. LES results are presented here for rotational Reynolds numbers ranging from Re=7Ã—104 to Re=7Ã—105. Turbulent quantities are shown to compare very favorably with results of direct numerical simulation (DNS) and experimental measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Nasal inhalation helps to protect the lungs from detrimental effects of toxic particles which, however, may also place the nasal and adjacent tissues at risk. Alternatively, drug-aerosol deposition on pre-determined nasal airway surfaces can be a modern pathway for rapid medical treatment. The present study focuses on inertial particles in the range of , subject to steady laminar flow rates of 7.5 and 20Â L/min. In contrast to ultrafine particles, for certain fine particle sizes deposition is strongly affected by wall roughness, which was incorporated with a selective micro-size airway-surface layer. The validated computer simulation results show that the inertial particle deposition in human nasal cavities increases with increasing impaction parameter, . Most of the deposition occurs in the anterior part of the human nasal cavities, especially in the nasal valve region. Considering drug-aerosol targeting, an optimal impaction parameter value exists which generates for normal inlet conditions the largest deposition in desired areas, e.g., the middle meatus, inferior meatus and olfactory regions. However, the absolute deposition efficiencies, especially in the inferior meatus and olfactory region, are very small because particles hardly reach those regions due to the complex nasal geometric structures. The influence of gravity was also analyzed and an experimentally validated correlation for inertial particle deposition in human nasal cavities has been provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Biofluid mechanics is increasingly applied in support of diagnosis and decision-making for treatment of clinical pathologies. Exploring the relationship between blood flow phenomena and pathophysiological observations is enhanced by continuing advances in the imaging modalities, measurement techniques, and capabilities of computational models. When combined with underlying physiological models, a powerful set of tools becomes available to address unmet clinical needs, predominantly in the direction of enhanced diagnosis, as well as assessment and prediction of treatment outcomes. This position paper presents an overview of current approaches and future developments along this theme that were discussed at the 5th International Biofluid Symposium and Workshop held at the California Institute of Technology in 2008. The introduction of novel mechanical biomarkers in device design and optimization, and applications in the characterization of more specific and focal conditions such as aneurysms, are at the center of attention. Further advances in integrative modeling, incorporating multiscale and multiphysics techniques are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The amelioration of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) by maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) surgery can be predicted by analyzing anatomical airway changes with 3-dimensional (3D) geometrical reconstruction and computational fluid dynamics. Computer Enabling Technology Lab (ETLab) and Computational Simulation Lab (CSLab) can be used to analyze anatomic airway change for previously operated patients with a clinical cure of OSAS. MMA surgery reduces airway resistance and pressure effort (gradient) of OSAS by increasing the dimension of the airway. ETLab has been used to reconstruct the upper airway as a 3D computer model (bone and soft tissue surrounding the pharyngeal airway) from existing helical computed tomography scan format of OSAS patients. ETLab can compare and construct the geometry with numerical meshes of the airway between pre- and postoperative MMA by the use of bioengineering software. This technology uses high-fidelity computation fluid dynamic simulations, developed at the CSLab, for prediction and analysis of the flow field in the airway for pre- and postoperative MMA. It is possible to use the simulation to predict the likely success of future treatment and develop a prognostic factor. The soft- and hard-tissue mesh is used to determine the pre- and postoperative differences in the facial and pharyngeal tongue base for soft-tissue change associated with hard-tissue movement. This correlation predicts the amount of surgical movement necessary to create an adequate airflow. These results help define the surgical techniques in OSAS for more precise identification of upper airway anatomical features. This process correlates the area and pressure change at the velopharynx, oropharynx, and retroglossal space of the upper airway by the ETLab. Results can compare with polysomnogram and cure rates. 3D computer analysis can be used to test flow dynamics in the human airway for surgical treatment of OSAS.},

  Abstract                 = {Most previous experimental studies of aerosol inhalability were conducted in wind tunnels for windspeeds greater than 0.5 ms- 1 . While that body of work was used to establish a convention for the inhalable fraction, results from studies in calm air chambers (for essentially zero windspeed) are being discussed as the basis of a modified criterion. However, information is lacking for windspeeds in the intermediate range, which - it so happens - pertain to most actual workplaces. With this in mind, we have developed a new experimental system to assess inhalability - and, ultimately, personal sampler performance - for aerosols with particle aerodynamic diameter within the range from about 9 to 90 Î¼m for ultra-low windspeed environments from about 0.1 to 0.5 ms 1 . This new system contains an aerosol test facility, fully described elsewhere, that combines the physical attributes and performance characteristics of moving air wind tunnels and calm air chambers, both of which have featured individually in previous research. It also contains a specially-designed breathing, heated, life-sized mannequin that allows for accurate recovery of test particulate material that has been inhaled. Procedures have been developed that employ test aerosols of well-defined particle size distribution generated mechanically from narrowly-graded powders of fused alumina. Using this new system, we have conducted an extensive set of new experiments to measure the inhalability of a human subject (as represented by the mannequin), aimed at filling the current knowledge gap for conditions that are more realistic than those embodied in most previous research. These data reveal that inhalability throughout the range of interest is significantly different based on windspeed, indicating a rise in aspiration efficiency as windspeed decreases. Breathing flowrate and mode of breathing (i.e. nose versus mouth breathing) did not show significant differences for the inhalability of aerosols. On the whole however, the data obtained here are within the range of inhalability data that exist from the large body of the previous experimental work performed at the higher windspeeds. These latest findings are an important contribution to the ongoing discussion in international standards-setting bodies about the possible adjustment of the quantitative definition of what constitutes the inhalable fraction.},

  Abstract                 = {A three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, coupled with a meteorological radiation and surface physics package, is used to model the mean flow field and tracer dispersion in the vicinity of an idealized cubical building. We first compare the simulations with earlier numerical studies as well as towing-tank laboratory experiments, where radiation effects were not included. Our simulations capture most of the features revealed by the towing-tank data, including the variation of the flow reattachment point as a function of Froude number and the induction of a prominent lee wave in the low Froude number regime. The simulated tracer concentration also compares very favorably with the data. We then assess the thermal effects due to radiative heating on the ground and building including shading by the building, on the mean flow and tracer dispersion. Our simulations show that convergence within and beyond the cavity zone causes a substantial lofting of the air mass downstream from the building. This lofting results from the combination of thermal heating of the ground and building roof, and vortex circulation associated with the horseshoe eddy along the lateral sides of the building. The specific effect of shading on the flow field is isolated by comparing simulations for which the radiative heating and shading patterns are kept constant, but the environmental wind direction is altered. It is found that the shading exerts local cooling, which can be combined into the overall thermodynamic interaction, described above, to effectively alter the circulation downstream from the building.},

Structured questionnaires were used to define rhinitis, asthma, and comorbidity, and allergen skin prick tests were used to define atopy. Health-related quality of life was assessed by short-form 36 questionnaires. Results: In total, 982 elderly adults (98.2\%) were included in the present study. The prevalence of rhinitis was 25.6\% and did not decrease until 90 years of age. The prevalence of atopy was 17.2\% (18.8\% in participants with rhinitis), and atopy did not show a significant association with rhinitis. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, relations between asthma and rhinitis were significant. Among comorbid conditions, none were significantly associated with rhinitis. In the short-form 36 questionnaire analyses, rhinitis was independently related to a decrease in the physical aspects of quality of life. Conclusion: The present study found a high prevalence of nonallergic rhinitis in elderly participants, which was significantly related to asthma and quality of life.

By simulating the tubular airway structures and realistic bifurcation shapes, anatomically accurate representations of human lungs are obtained. These computer models are designed for use in computational fluid dynamic applications and particle trajectory analyses, and to be complimentary to medical imaging (gamma scintigraphy) protocols.},

  Abstract                 = {Turbulent free shear flows are subject to the well-known Kelvin-Helmholtz type [Panton RL. Incompressible flow. John Wiley and Sons; 1984. p. 675] instability, and it is well-known that any free shear flow which approximates a thin vorticity layer will be unstable to a wide range of amplitudes and frequencies of disturbance. In fact, much of what constitutes flow control in turbulent free shear layers consists of feeding a prescribed destabilizing disturbance to these layers. The question in the control of free shear flows is not whether the shear layer will be stable, but whether you can influence how the layer becomes unstable. In most cases, since these flows are so receptive to forcing input, and naturally tend toward instability, large changes in flow conditions can be achieved with very small amplitude periodic inputs. Recently, it has been discovered that turbulent free shear flows can also be stabilized using periodic forcing. This is, at first glance, counter-intuitive, considering our long history of considering these flows to be very unstable to forcing input. It is a phenomenon not described in modern fluid dynamic text books. The forcing required to achieve this effect (which we will call turbulent shear layer stabilization) is of a much higher amplitude and frequency than the more traditional type of shear layer flow control effect seen in the literature (which we will call turbulent shear layer destabilization). A numerical study is undertaken to investigate the effect of frequency of pulsed mass injection on the nature of stabilization, destabilization and acoustic suppression in high speed cavity flows. An implicit, 2nd-order in space and time flow solver, coupled with a recently developed hybrid RANS-LES (Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes-Large Eddy Simulation) turbulence model by Nichols and Nelson [Nichols RH, Nelson CC. Weapons bay acoustic predictions using a multi-scale turbulence model. In: Proceedings of the ITEA 2001 aircraft-stores compatibility symposium, March 2001], is utilized in a Chimera-based parallel format. This tool is used to numerically simulate both an unsuppressed cavity in resonance, as well as the effect of mass-addition pulsed jet flow control on cavity flow physics and ultimately, cavity acoustic levels. Frequency (and in a limited number of cases, amplitude) of pulse is varied, from 0Â Hz (steady) up to 5000Â Hz. The change in the character of the flow control effect as pulsing frequency is changed is described, and linked to changes in acoustic levels. Limited comparison to 1/10th scale experiments is presented. The observed local stabilization of the cavity turbulent shear layer, when subjected to high frequency pulsed blowing, is shown in simulation to be the result of a violent instability and breakdown of a pair of opposite sign vortical structures created with each high frequency "pulse". This unique shear layer stabilization behavior is only observed in simulation above a certain critical pulsing frequency. Below this critical frequency, pulsing is shown in simulation to provide little benefit with respect to suppression of high cavity acoustic levels.},

The present study explores the breakup of a two-dimensional liquid sheet in the presence of co-flow air with emphasis on the extent to which liquid properties affect breakup. Three liquids, selected with varying values of viscosity and surface tension, are introduced through a twin-fluid, two-dimensional nozzle. A pulsed laser imaging system is used to determine the sheet structure at breakup, the distance and time to breakup, and the character of the ligaments and droplets formed. Experiments are conducted at two liquid flow rates with five flow rates of co-flowing air. Liquid properties affect the residence time required to initiate sheet breakup, and alter the time and length scales in the breakup mechanism.},

After storage in an array, the spatial coordinates are visualized with an appropriate graphic editor, enabling the combination of respective deposition images with lung outlines and the creation of two-dimensional distributions by sectioning the three-dimensional structures at pre-defined positions.},

Methods&nbsp;&nbsp;Rifampicin was encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles by a solvent evaporation process, spray dried into PNAPs containing varying amounts of nanoparticles, and characterized for physical and aerosol properties. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed with formulations delivered to guinea pigs by intratracheal insufflation and compared to oral and intravenous delivery of rifampicin. Results&nbsp;&nbsp;The PNAP formulations possessed properties suitable for efficient deposition in the lungs. In vitro release showed an initial burst of rifampicin, with the remainder available for release beyond eight hours. PNAPs delivered to guinea pigs by insufflation achieved systemic levels of rifampicin detected for six to eight hours. Moreover, rifampicin concentrations remained detectable in lung tissue and cells up to and beyond eight hours. Conversely, after pulmonary delivery of an aerosol without nanoparticles, rifampicin could not be detected in the lungs at eight hours. Conclusions&nbsp;&nbsp;Our results indicate that rifampicin can be formulated into an aggregated nanoparticle form that, once delivered to animals, achieves systemic exposure and extends levels of drug in the lungs.},

Whether inhaled particles reach the bronchial or alveolated airways or are deposited in the upper airways (nasal or oral passage) depends upon a number of factors which are discussed in this paper. These factors can be divided into two groups: those which relate to the air flow properties and those which relate to the particles. If these factors are known to a sufficient degree, the regional deposition efficiency of the inhaled particles can be estimated. Particles once deposited in the upper airway are cleared by one of several mechanisms depending on the type of particle, site of deposition and functional state of the airway surface. The clearance processes and their importance for various particles are discussed.},

The measurements were conducted over a range of flow rates from 1.4 to 28.71 minâˆ’1 (501 minâˆ’1 for sizes from 4.6 to 200 nm) using radon and thoron decay product aerosols as well as larger ultrafine particles.

  Abstract                 = {Nasal obstruction is the leading symptom observed among patients who have chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with or without nasal polyposis. After failure of medical therapy, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) has emerged as the preferred treatment of CRS. Interestingly, although patient-reported outcomes show unequivocal relief of nasal obstruction after FESS, studies measuring nasal airflow and resistance demonstrate more modest improvements. This article provides an overview of the physiology of nasal airflow sensation, the burden of nasal obstruction in patients who have CRS, and the efficacy of FESS in addressing nasal obstruction in this population. Additionally, advances in airflow modeling that may enable improved preoperative planning for the relief of nasal obstruction after FESS are discussed.},

The models were constructed based on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images acquired from a patient with severe RV dilatation and solved by ADINA. Our results indicate that the patch model with contracting myocardium leads to decreased stress level in the patch area, improved RV function and patch area contractility.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of how airflows through the nasal passages relies heavily on model studies, as the complexity and relative inaccessibility of the anatomy prevents detailed in vivo measurement. Almost all models to date fail to incorporate the geometry of the external nose, instead employing a truncated inflow. Typically, flow is specified to enter the model domain either directly at the nares (nostrils), or via an artificial pipe inflow tract attached to the nares. This study investigates the effect of the inflow geometry on flow predictions during steady nasal inspiration. Models that fully replicate the internal and external nasal airways of two anatomically distinct subjects are used as a reference to compare the effects of common in flow treatments on physiologically relevant quantities including regional wall shear stress and particle residence time distributions. In flow geometry truncation is found to affect flow predictions significantly, though slightly less so for the subject displaying more pronounced passage area contraction up to the internal nasal valve. For both subject geometries, a tapered pipe in flow provides a better approximation to the natural in flow than a blunt velocity pro. le applied to the nares. Computational modelling issues are also briefly outlined, by comparing quantities predicted using different surface tessellations, and by evaluation of domain-splitting techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Nasal drug administration has been used as an alternative route for the systemic availability of drugs restricted to intravenous administration. This is due to the large surface area, porous endothelial membrane, high total blood flow, the avoidance of first-pass metabolism, and ready accessibility. The nasal administration of drugs, including numerous compound, peptide and protein drugs, for systemic medication has been widely investigated in recent years. Drugs are cleared rapidly from the nasal cavity after intranasal administration, resulting in rapid systemic drug absorption. Several approaches are here discussed for increasing the residence time of drug formulations in the nasal cavity, resulting in improved nasal drug absorption. The article highlights the importance and advantages of the drug delivery systems applied via the nasal route, which have bioadhesive properties. Bioadhesive, or more appropriately, mucoadhesive systems have been prepared for both oral and peroral administration in the past. The nasal mucosa presents an ideal site for bioadhesive drug delivery systems. In this review we discuss the effects of microspheres and other bioadhesive drug delivery systems on nasal drug absorption. Drug delivery systems, such as microspheres, liposomes and gels have been demonstrated to have good bioadhesive characteristics and that swell easily when in contact with the nasal mucosa. These drug delivery systems have the ability to control the rate of drug clearance from the nasal cavity as well as protect the drug from enzymatic degradation in nasal secretions. The mechanisms and effectiveness of these drug delivery systems are described in order to guide the development of specific and effective therapies for the future development of peptide preparations and other drugs that otherwise should be administered parenterally. As a consequence, bioavailability and residence time of the drugs that are administered via the nasal route can be increased by bioadhesive drug delivery systems. Although the majority of this work involving the use of microspheres, liposomes and gels is limited to the delivery of macromolecules (e.g., insulin and growth hormone), the general principles involved could be applied to other drug candidates. It must be emphasized that many drugs can be absorbed well if the contact time between formulation and the nasal mucosa is optimized.},

  Abstract                 = {Gas-solid momentum transfer is a fundamental problem that is characterized by the dependence of normalized average fluid-particle force F on solid volume fraction [phi] and the Reynolds number based on the mean slip velocity Rem. In this work we report particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of interphase momentum transfer in flow past fixed random assemblies of monodisperse spheres with finite fluid inertia using a continuum Navier-Stokes solver. This solver is based on a new formulation we refer to as the Particle-resolved Uncontaminated-fluid Reconcilable Immersed Boundary Method (PUReIBM). The principal advantage of this formulation is that the fluid stress at the particle surface is calculated directly from the flow solution (velocity and pressure fields), which when integrated over the surfaces of all particles yields the average fluid-particle force. We demonstrate that PUReIBM is a consistent numerical method to study gas-solid flow because it results in a force density on particle surfaces that is reconcilable with the averaged two-fluid theory. The numerical convergence and accuracy of PUReIBM are established through a comprehensive suite of validation tests. The normalized average fluid-particle force F is obtained as a function of solid volume fraction [phi] (0.1Â [less-than-or-equals, slant]Â [phi]Â [less-than-or-equals, slant]Â 0.5) and mean flow Reynolds number Rem (0.01Â [less-than-or-equals, slant]Â RemÂ [less-than-or-equals, slant]Â 300) for random assemblies of monodisperse spheres. These results extend previously reported results of (Hill et al., 2001a) and (Hill et al., 2001b) to a wider range of [phi], Rem, and are more accurate than those reported by Beetstra et al. (2007). Differences between the drag values obtained from PUReIBM and the drag correlation of Beetstra et al. (2007) are as high as 30% for Rem in the range 100-300. We take advantage of PUReIBM's ability to directly calculate the relative contributions of pressure and viscous stress to the total fluid-particle force, which is useful in developing drag correlations. Using a scaling argument, Hill et al. (2001b) proposed that the viscous contribution is independent of Rem but the pressure contribution is linear in Rem (for RemÂ >Â 50). However, from PUReIBM simulations we find that the viscous contribution is not independent of the mean flow Reynolds number, although the pressure contribution does indeed vary linearly with Rem in accord with the analysis of Hill et al. (2001b). An improved correlation for F in terms of [phi] and Rem is proposed that corrects the existing correlations in Rem range 100-300. Since this drag correlation has been inferred from simulations of fixed particle assemblies, it does not include the effect of mobility of the particles. However, the fixed-bed simulation approach is a good approximation for high Stokes number particles, which are encountered in most gas-solid flows. This improved drag correlation can be used in CFD simulations of fluidized beds that solve the average two-fluid equations where the accuracy of the drag law affects the prediction of overall flow behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {In a lumber mill in the northern inland region of British Columbia, Canada, we measured inhalable particulate, resin acid, and monoterpene exposures, and estimated wood dust exposures. Potential determinants of exposure were documented concurrently, including weather conditions, tree species, wood conditions, jobs, tasks, equipment used, and certain control measures. Over 220 personal samples were taken for each contaminant. Geometric mean concentrations were 0.98mg/m3 for inhalable particulate, 0.49mg/m3 for estimated wood dust, 8.04Î¼g/m3 for total resin acids, and 1.11mg/m3 for total monoterpenes. Multiple regression models for all contaminants indicated that spruce and pine produced higher exposures than alpine fir or mixed tree species, cleaning up sawdust increased exposures, and personnel enclosure was an effective means of reducing exposures. Sawing wood in the primary breakdown areas of the mill was the main contributor to monoterpene exposures, so exposures were highest for the barker operator, the head rig operator, the canter operator, the board edgers, and a roving utility worker in the sawmill, and lowest in the planer mills (after kiln drying of the lumber) and yard. Cleaning up sawdust, planing kiln-dried lumber, and driving mobile equipment in the yard substantially increased exposures to both inhalable particulate and estimated wood dust. Jobs at the front end of the sawmill where primary breakdown of the logs takes place had lower exposures. Resin acid exposures followed a similar pattern, except that yard driving jobs did not increase exposures.},

  Abstract                 = {Flow simulations in airways and arteries allow the non-invasive study of transport and deposition processes in these vessel systems. Individual vessel geometries as input for such simulations are highly desirable. Computed tomography (CT) permits the acquisition of binary data to reconstruct such geometries. To prove the suitability of this reconstruction method, we compared measured with simulated velocities within model bifurcations. Particle image velocimetry was applied to measure flow velocities. Numerical simulations of these velocities were carried out by using the CT data of the same models as input to flow calculations (CFD). Within the resolution limits good agreement between measured and simulated velocities was found. For the smallest bifurcation (tube diameter: 2 mm) the agreement was less, indicating a methodical limitation by the actual resolution of the CT-scan technique. The study showed that a combination of CT and CFD can be considered as an appropriate step towards realistic simulations of particle transportation and deposition in individual geometries of the respiratory or cardiovascular systems.},

The flow field, in turn, is deeply influenced by the design parameters of both casing and impeller geometry. In this paper, the relationship between the design parameters of the geometrical configuration and fan performance is discussed in a theoretical perspective, analyzing the features of the corresponding flow fields. These are reconstructed by a numerical study on cross-flow fan operation carried out for a representative set of configurations at different throttling conditions. Time-accurate solutions for a two-dimensional viscous and incompressible model of the fan using a sliding mesh technique are calculated with a commercial CFD code.

This study was designed to evaluate the suitability of an aqueous solution of voriconazole solubilized with sulfobutyl ether-[beta]-cyclodextrin for targeted drug delivery to the lungs via nebulization. A solution was prepared such that the inspired aerosol dose was isotonic with an acceptable mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.98Â [mu]m and a fine particle fraction of 71.7%. Following single and multiple inhaled doses, high voriconazole concentrations were observed within 30Â min in the lung tissue and plasma. Drug solubilization with sulfobutyl ether-[beta]-cyclodextrin contributed to the rapid and high drug concentrations in plasma following inhalation. Maximal concentrations in the lung and plasma were 11.0Â Â±Â 1.6Â [mu]g/g wet lung weight and 7.9Â Â±Â 0.68Â [mu]g/mL, respectively, following a single inhaled dose with a corresponding tissue/plasma concentration ratio of 1.4 to 1. Following multiple inhaled doses, peak concentrations in lung tissue and plasma were 6.73Â Â±Â 3.64Â [mu]g/g wet lung weight and 2.32Â Â±Â 1.52Â [mu]g/mL, respectively. AUC values in lung tissue and plasma were also high. The clinically relevant observed pharmacokinetic parameters of inhaled aqueous solutions of voriconazole suggest that therapeutic outcomes could be benefitted through the use of inhaled voriconazole.},

We extend the hybrid model by a Smagorinsky subgrid scale model for both the fluid flow and the heat flux. Validation studies are presented for laminar and turbulent natural convection in a cavity at various Rayleigh numbers up to 5Â Ã—Â 1010 for PrÂ =Â 0.71 using a serial code in 2D and a parallel code in 3D, respectively. Correlations of the Nusselt number are discussed and compared to benchmark data. As an application we simulated forced convection in a building with inner courtyard at ReÂ =Â 50Â 000.},

We present a new airway segmentation method based on fuzzy connectivity. Small adaptive regions of interest are used that follow the airway branches as they are segmented. This method works on various types of scans (low dose and regular dose, normal subjects and diseased subjects) without the need for the user to manually adjust any parameters. Comparison with a commonly used region-growing segmentation algorithm shows that this method retrieves a significantly higher count of airway branches. In an additional processing step, this method provides accurate cross-sectional airway measurements that are conducted in the original gray-level volume. Validation on a phantom shows that subvoxel accuracy is achieved for all airway sizes and airway orientations. The utility of the reported method is demonstrated in a comparative analysis of normal and cystic fibrosis airway trees.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary The increasing demand of CFD in resolving numerous fluid-flow problems is growing within the scientific community. Needless to say, such an accomplishment could only have been made possible through the meticulous developments by persistent researchers and more recently, the extension to industrial usage by dedicated code developers that have resulted in the availability of a number of commercial CFD packages. The cornerstone of any CFD analysis lies in the heart of transport equations and the building blocks of efficient numerical techniques. Throughout this book, the authors have continually stressed the importance of grasping the essential conservation equations as described in Chapter 3 and the basic understanding of numerical approximations considered in Chapters 4 and 5. In Chapter 6, the authors further provided useful guidelines of handling practical flow problems such as the requirement of suitable turbulence models to resolve real fluid-flow processes, which incidentally exemplifies the range of computed results presented in Chapter 1.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents the 3D LES study of the non-isothermal transitional and turbulent flow in rotor/stator sealed cavity with a rotating inner and a stationary outer cylinder. The stator and the outer cylinder are warmer than the rotor and the inner cylinder. Computations have been performed for the cavity of aspect ratio LÂ =Â (R1Â -Â R0)/2hÂ =Â 5, curvature parameter RmÂ =Â (R1Â +Â R0)/(R1Â -Â R0)Â =Â 3, Reynolds numbers , thermal Rossby numbers BÂ =Â [beta](T2Â -Â T1)Â =Â 0.01-0.4, and for the cavity (LÂ =Â 9, RmÂ =Â 1.5, ReÂ =Â 100,000-150,000, BÂ =Â 0.01-0.4). Computations we based on the efficient pseudo-spectral Chebyshev-Fourier method (Serre, E., Pulicani, J.P., 2001. A three-dimensional pseudospectral method for rotating flows in a cylinder. Computers and Fluids, 30, 491). In Large Eddy Simulations we used a version of the dynamic Smagorinsky eddy viscosity model proposed by Meneveau (Meneveau, C., Lund, T.S., Cabot, W.H., 1996, A Lagrangian dynamic subgrid-scale model of turbulence. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 319, 353-385), in which the averaging is performed over the particle pathline. This approach allowed us to perform computations for higher Reynolds numbers for confined rotating flows, which are strongly inhomogeneous and anisotropic. Results showed that the turbulence is concentrated mostly in the stator boundary layer with a maximum at the junction between the stator and the outer cylinder. For the cavity of aspect ratio LÂ =Â 5 the stator boundary layer was fully turbulent for ReÂ [greater-or-equal, slanted]Â 100,000, whereas the rotor boundary layer was still laminar. The influence of the thermal Rossby number on the flow structure and the basic state was not significant. The correlation formulas, for predicting the distribution of local Nusselt numbers along disks as well as the correlation formulas for the averaged Nusselt numbers depending on the Reynolds numbers are given on the basis of our results.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing worldwide. One of the obesity-related complications that has received increasing attention in recent years is sleep-disordered breathing. Obese children are at a higher risk of developing sleep-disordered breathing, including habitual snoring, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and desaturations preceded by central apneas. Both adiposity and upper airway factors, such as adenotonsillar hypertrophy, modulate the severity of sleep-disordered breathing in these children. Adenotonsillectomy seems to be effective against obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in obese children. On the other hand, there are limited data on the effects of weight loss and of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure on the severity of sleep apnea in obese children and adolescents.},

  Abstract                 = {An approach combining laboratory experiments and numerical modelling was used to investigate the behaviour of a floc population during an idealized tidal cycle. The experiment was conducted on suspended sediments at a concentration of 93Â mgÂ l-1 collected in the field. It was based on a jar test device to reproduce tidal-induced turbulence and coupled with a CCD camera system and image post-processing software to monitor floc size distribution. At the same time, a 0D size-class based aggregation/fragmentation model (FLOCMOD) was developed to simulate changes in the floc population over the tidal cycle. Experimental results revealed strong variability of the behaviour of microfloc and macrofloc populations with respect to the varying shear rates observed in situ. In particular, the major dependency of floc sizes on the Kolmogorov microscale was confirmed. Time-scale differences were also observed for aggregation and fragmentation processes which led to asymmetrical floc behaviour despite symmetrical tidal forcing. Model results, i.e. average diameter, maximum diameter and floc size distribution, were in good agreement with experimental data with an RMS error between observed and computed average diameters of below 25Â [mu]m over the tidal cycle. FLOCMOD was optimized in terms of the time step, number of size classes and size range: only seven classes ranging from 50 to 643Â [mu]m associated with a dynamically-adaptable time step were needed to correctly reproduce experimental results, characterized by an RMS error of less than 5Â [mu]m with respect to the reference case (100 classes from 4 to 1500Â [mu]m). Sensitivity analyses were performed on major parameters or processes: initial floc size distribution, primary particle size, fractal dimension and fragmentation function (binary, ternary, erosion or collision-induced fragmentation). Results showed that initial floc size distribution played a role only during the first aggregation stage. Low variability of the fractal dimension did not significantly modify model results, while larger differences were observed when the primary particle size was changed, especially towards the largest sizes (10Â [mu]m). Nevertheless, these two structural parameters had a strong impact on the calculated mean settling velocity with differences of 0.2Â mmÂ s-1 compared with the reference case. Different fragmentation functions were shown to significantly modify model results, except for collision-induced shear stress. In particular, combining floc erosion with binary breakup in the shear fragmentation term enabled us to reproduce bimodal distributions, patterns that are typically observed in situ.},

In addition, the design includes a system for recording the behavioral (rating scale) and physiological (breathing, electrodermal reaction (ED), plethysmography (PL)) signals given by the subject. Both systems present the advantage of being compatible with fMRI magnetic fields since no ferrous material is used in the Faraday cage and signals are transmitted via an optical transmission interface to an acquisition system.},

  Abstract                 = {In simulating biofluid flow domains, structured hexahedral meshes are often associated with high quality solutions. However, extensive time and effort are required to generate these meshes for complex branching geometries. This study evaluates potential mesh configurations that may maintain the advantages of the structured hexahedral style while providing significant savings in grid construction time and complexity. Specifically, the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of unstructured hexahedral, prismatic and hybrid meshes based on grid convergence and local particle deposition fractions in a bifurcating model of the respiratory tract. A grid convergence index (GCI) has been implemented to assess the mesh-independence of solutions in cases where true grid halving is not feasible. Localized and total deposition values have been evaluated for particles ranging from 1 through 10Â [mu]m in planar and out-of-plane geometries. Structured hexahedral, unstructured hexahedral and prismatic meshes were found to provide GCI values of approximately 5% and nearly identical velocity fields. In contrast, the hexahedral-tetrahedral hybrid model resulted in GCI values that were significantly higher in comparison to the other meshes. The resulting velocity field for the hybrid configuration differed from the hexahedral and prismatic solutions by up to an order of magnitude at some locations. Considering the deposition of 10Â [mu]m particles in the planar configuration, all meshes considered provided relatively close agreement (2-20% difference) with an available experimental study. For all particle sizes considered, local and total deposition results for the structured and unstructured hexahedral meshes were similar. In contrast, the prismatic and hybrid geometries resulted in significantly higher deposition rates when compared to the hexahedral meshes for particles less than 10Â [mu]m. As a result, only the unstructured hexahedral mesh was found to provide overall performance similar to the structured hexahedral configuration with the advantage of a significant savings in construction time. These results emphasize the importance of aligning control volume gridlines with the predominant flow direction in biofluid applications that involve long and thin internal flow domains. Future studies are needed to assess other forms of the hybrid configuration and the effects of other element styles.},

  Abstract                 = {Cascade impactors are commonly used to assess the size characteristics of aerosols in toxicology and pharmaceutical applications. These aerosol instruments have been developed and refined over decades. However, a number of questions remain related to impactor performance, including the influence of electrostatic charge on measured size distributions. The objective of this study was to develop a validated CFD model of the Mark II Andersen cascade impactor (ACI) and apply this model to evaluate the effects of particle charge on deposition. The flow field was simulated using a commercial CFD code for incompressible laminar and transitional flows. Particle trajectories and deposition were evaluated using a well tested Lagrangian tracking approach that accounts for impaction, sedimentation, diffusion, and electrostatic attraction. Particle charge levels typical of dry powder inhaler (DPI) and metered dose inhaler (MDI) aerosols were considered for a particle size range of 0.3-12Â [mu]m. As a model validation, computational predictions of cutoff d50 diameters for each of the eight ACI stages were found to be within 10% difference of existing experimental and manufacturer data. Results indicated that charges consistent with DPI and MDI aerosols increased deposition fraction in Stages 0-3 by up to 30% and increased deposition fraction in Stages 4-7 by up to an order of magnitude. For Stages 0-3, both DPI and MDI charges reduced the d50 value by approximately 10% or less. In contrast, charged aerosols reduced the d50 values in Stages 4 and 5 by 200% and 60%, respectively. All charged submicrometer aerosols considered deposited in Stages 6 and 7. Increasing the particle charge by an order of magnitude from DPI to MDI values had a relatively small effect on further decreasing the cutoff size of each stage. In conclusion, these results can be used to approximate the actual aerodynamic diameter of a charged pharmaceutical aerosol based on measurements in a standard ACI. Future applications of the developed ACI model include evaluating the influence of space charge on deposition and quantifying the effects of aerosol condensation and evaporation on size assessment.},

An overview of the different Navier-Stokes codes used in Europe is given, and on-going developments are outlined. The current state of progress is illustrated by computed steady and unsteady solutions to industrial problems, ranging from airfoil characteristics, flow around an isolated wing, to full aircraft configurations. A discussion on the future industrial design environment is given, and developments in Europe towards a more integrated design approach with underlying concepts like [`]concurrent engineering (CE)' and the [`]virtual product (VP)' are summarized.

  Abstract                 = {Determination of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) as a measure of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a widely accepted methodology. However, the outcome of such a determination depends on the method used, is time consuming and insufficient for prediction of the effect of all treatment modalities. For these reasons more methods for evaluating the severity of OSAHS, based on different imaging modalities, have been looked into and recent studies have shown that anatomical properties determined from three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images are good markers for the severity of the OSAHS. Therefore, we correlated anatomical measurements of a 3D reconstruction of the upper airway together with flow simulation results with the severity of OSAHS in order to find a combination of variables to indicate the severity of OSAHS in patients. The AHI of 20 non-selected, consecutive patients has been determined during a polysomnography. All patients also underwent a CT scan from which a 3D model of the upper airway geometry was reconstructed. This 3D model was used to evaluate the anatomical properties of the upper airway in OSAHS patients as well as to perform computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations to evaluate the airflow and resistance of this upper airway. It has been shown that a combination of the smallest cross-sectional area and the resistance together with the body mass index (BMI) form a set of markers that predict very well the severity of OSAHS in patients within this study. We believe that these markers can be used to evaluate the outcome of an OSAHS treatment.},

First, a cavity formation model is set up, based on a three-dimensional (3D) non-cavitation model of Navier-Stokes equations with a large eddy simulation (LES) scheme for weakly compressible flows. A fifth-order polynomial curve is adopted to describe the relationship between density coefficient ratio and pressure coefficient when cavitation occurs. The Navier-Stokes equations including cavitation bubble clusters are solved using the finite-volume approach with time-marching scheme, and MacCormack's explicit-corrector scheme is adopted. Simulations are carried out in a 3D field acting on a hydrofoil NACA0015 at angles of attack 4Â°, 8Â° and 20Â°, with cavitation numbers [sigma]Â =Â 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0, ReÂ =Â 106, and a 360Â Ã—Â 63Â Ã—Â 29 meshing system. We study time-dependent sheet/cloud cavitation structures, caused by the interaction of viscous objects, such as vortices, and cavitation bubbles. At small angles of attack (4Â°), the sheet cavity is relatively stable just by oscillating in size at the accumulation stage; at 8Â° it has a tendency to break away from the upper foil section, with the cloud cavitation structure becoming apparent; at 20Â°, the flow separates fully from the leading edge of the hydrofoil, and the vortex cavitation occurs. Comparisons with other studies, carried out mainly in the context of flow patterns on which prior experiments and simulations were done, demonstrate the power of our model. Overall, it can snapshot the collapse of cloud cavitation, and allow a study of flow patterns and their instabilities, such as "crescent-shaped regions."},

  Abstract                 = {Classical theoretical treatments for diffusional deposition of particles in tube flow describe the losses within straight tubes. The plumbing in many systems of practical interest, notably aerosol instruments, consists of short segments of tubing connected by elbows, bends, and other disturbances. To understand the particle losses in such systems, particle losses in tube flows containing bends and elbows has been studied for Reynolds numbers ranging from 80 to 950. Monodisperse aerosol of 5-15 nm diameter particles passed through individual bends or elbows, and through a number of bends or elbows in series. The results show that the effect of bends and elbows on particle diffusion loss is significant. For a flow configuration with four elbows in series, the penetration efficiency drops as much as 44% when compared to a straight tube with the same length. For Reynolds number smaller than 250, the enhancement of diffusion losses due to bends and elbows is sensitive to both the relative orientations of the bends and elbows and the lengths of straight tubing between them. Because of this sensitivity, direct calibration or simulation is required to assess nanoparticle penetration efficiencies for any flow system containing bends or elbows at low Reynolds number. When the Reynolds number exceeds 250, the enhancement is insensitive to the actual flow configurations. Experimental results are presented, which may be useful for design of aerosol flow systems at Reynolds number larger than 250.},

Under the low back-pressure ambient conditions, the spray behavior exhibited a hollow cone with wide spray angle and initial spray slug at the tip, while the spray presented a solid cone in the case of high back-pressure. Vortexes in the opposite direction existed in the rear part of the spray under low back-pressure ambient conditions while the vortexes formed in the middle part under high back-pressure ambient conditions. Experiments also showed that methanol had the largest cone angle, while ethanol and gasoline presented almost the same cone angle. Simulation results indicated that methanol and ethanol had a slightly larger Sauter mean diameter (SMD) than that of gasoline with swirl injector. The SMD profile of methanol coincided well with that of ethanol under low back-pressure ambient conditions, but displayed a slightly larger value under high back-pressure due to fuel evaporation Numerical simulation could successfully demonstrate the spray characteristics of high-pressure swirl injector for methanol and ethanol fuels.},

  Abstract                 = {A direct numerical simulation (DNS) model for three-phase flow (solid, liquid, and gas) with the main purpose of analysing wet granulation processes is presented in this paper. In the present model, liquid-gas two-phase flow is solved by the constrained interpolation profile (CIP) method developed by Yabe et al. (2001) [1], and the interaction between fluid phases and solid particle phase is taken into account by using the immersed boundary (IB) method developed by Kajishima et al. (2001) [2]. The surface tension as well as the wetting are modelled by using the continuous surface force (CSF) model suggested by Brackbill et al. (1992) [3], and the dynamic contact angle is represented by Fukai's (1995) [4] approach, which selectively uses advancing and receding contact angles depending on the movement of fluid interfaces on a solid surface. The accuracy of the model is examined in terms of (i) the drag force exerted on a single particle, (ii) the drag force exerted on a regular particle array, (iii) the surface tension force, and (iv) the wetting. A number of test simulations have been carried out with different numerical cell sizes, and the results are compared with the reported experimental work and theoretical values.},

  Abstract                 = {A multi-technique approach to modelling artificially ventilated patients on the adult general intensive care unit (ICU) is proposed. Compartmental modelling techniques were used to describe the mechanical ventilator and the flexible hoses that connect it to the patient. 3D CFD techniques were used to model flow in the major airways and a Windkessel style balloon model was used to model the mechanical properties of the lungs. A multi-compartment model of the lung based on bifurcating tree structures representing the conducting airways and pulmonary circulation allowed lung disease to be modelled in terms of altered ratios within a lognormal distribution of values and it is from these that gas exchange was determined. A compartmental modelling tool, Bathfp, was used to integrate the different modelling techniques into a single model. The values of key parameters in the model could be obtained from measurements on patients in an ICU whilst a sensitivity analysis showed that the model was insensitive to the value of other parameters within it. Measured and modelled values for arterial blood gases and airflow parameters are compared for 46 ventilator settings obtained from 6 ventilator dependent patients. The results show correlation coefficients of 0.88 and 0.85 for the arterial partial pressures of the O2 and CO2, respectively (pÂ <Â 0.01) and of 0.99 and 0.96 for upper airway pressure and tidal volume, respectively (pÂ <Â 0.01). The difference between measured and modelled values was large in physiological terms, suggesting that some optimisation of the model is required.},

  Abstract                 = {There is considerable recent focus and concern about formaldehyde (FA). We have reviewed the literature on FA with focus on chemosensory perception in the airways and lung effects in indoor environments. Concentrations of FA, both personal and stationary, are on average in the order of 0.05Â mg/m3 or less in Europe and North America with the exception of new housing or buildings with extensive wooden surfaces, where the concentration may exceed 0.1Â mg/m3. With the eye the most sensitive organ, subjective irritation is reported at 0.3-0.5Â mg/m3, which is somewhat higher than reported odour thresholds. Objective effects in the eyes and airways occur around 0.6-1Â mg/m3. Dose-response relationships between FA and lung function effects have not been found in controlled human exposure studies below 1Â mg/m3, and epidemiological associations between FA concentrations and exacerbation of asthma in children and adults are encumbered by complex exposures. Neither experimental nor epidemiological studies point to major differences in susceptibility to FA among children, elderly, and asthmatics. People with personal trait of negative affectivity may report more symptoms. An air quality guideline of 0.1Â mg/m3 (0.08Â ppm) is considered protective against both acute and chronic sensory irritation in the airways in the general population assuming a log normal distribution of nasal sensory irritation.},

  Abstract                 = {As a human grows from birth to adulthood, both airway anatomy and breathing conditions vary, altering the deposition rate and pattern of inhaled aerosols. However, deposition studies have typically focused on adult subjects, results of which may not be readily extrapolated to children. This study numerically evaluated the age-related effects on the airflow and aerosol dynamics in image-based nose-throat models of a 10-day-old newborn, a 7-month-old infant, a 5-year-old child, and a 53-year-old adult. Differences in airway physiology, breathing resistance, and aerosol filtering efficiency among the four models were quantified and compared. A high-fidelity fluid-particle transport model was employed to simulate the multi-regime airflows and particle transport within the nasal-laryngeal airways. Ultrafine particles were evaluated under breathing conditions ranging from sedentary to heavy activities. Results of this study indicate that the nasal-laryngeal airways at different ages, albeit differ significantly in morphology and dimension, do not significantly affect the total deposition fractions or maximum local deposition enhancement for ultrafine aerosols. Further, the deposition partitioning in the sub-regions of interest is different among the four models. Results of this study corroborate the use of the in vivo -based diffusion parameter (D super(0.5) Q super(-0.28) ) over the replica-based parameter in correlating nasal-laryngeal depositions of ultrafine aerosols. Improved correlations have been developed for the four age groups by implementing this in vivo -based diffusion parameter as well as the Cunningham correction factor.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: How the facial interface affects particle inhalability and depositions within the airway is not well understood. Previous studies of inhalation dosimetry are limited to either inhalability or deposition, rather than the two studied in a systematic way. Objective: To systematically evaluate the effects of the facial interface on aerosol inhalability, nasal deposition and thoracic dose in a 5-year-old child airway model using a coupled imaging-computational fluid dynamics approach. Methods: A face-nose-throat model was developed from magnetic resonance imaging scans of a 5-year-old boy. Respiration airflows and particle transport were simulated with the low Reynolds number k-omega turbulence model and the Lagrangian tracking approach. Particles ranging from 1 to 70 mm were considered in a calm air. Results: Retaining the facial interface in the computational model induced substantial variations in flow dynamics, aerosol inhalability and thoracic doses. The nasal and thoracic deposition fractions were much lower with the facial interface due to the low inhalability into downward-facing nostrils and facial deposition losses. For a given inhalation rate of 10 L/min, including the facial interface reduced the thoracic dose by 5% for 2.5-mm particles and by 50% for 10 mm particles in the child model. Considering localized conditions, facial interface substantially increased depositions at the turbinate region and dorsal pharynx. Conclusion: This study highlighted the need to include facial interface in future numerical and in vitro studies. Findings of this study have practical implications in the design of aerosol samplers and interpretation of deposition data from studies without facial interfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {The deposition of hygroscopic aerosols is highly complex in nature, which results from a cumulative effect of dynamic particle growth and the real-time size-specific deposition mechanisms. The objective of this study is to evaluate hygroscopic effects on the particle growth, transport, and deposition of nasally inhaled aerosols across a range of 0.2â€“2.5 Î¼m in an adult image-based nose-throat model. Temperature and relative humidity fields were simulated using the LRN k-?‰ turbulence model and species transport model under a spectrum of thermo-humidity conditions. Particle growth and transport were simulated using a well validated Lagrangian tracking model coupled with a user-defined hygroscopic growth module. Results of this study indicate that the saturation level and initial particle size are the two major factors that determine the particle growth rate (d/d0), while the effect of inhalation flow rate is found to be not significant. An empirical correlation of condensation growth of nasally inhaled hygroscopic aerosols in adults has been developed based on a variety of thermo-humidity inhalation conditions. Significant elevated nasal depositions of hygroscopic aerosols could be induced by condensation growth for both sub-micrometer and small micrometer particulates. In particular, the deposition of initially 2.5 Î¼m hygroscopic aerosols was observed to be 5â€“8 times that of inert particles under warm to hot saturated conditions. Results of this study have important implications in exposure assessment in hot humid environments, where much higher risks may be expected compared to normal conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {As a human grows from birth to adulthood, both airway anatomy and breathing conditions vary that alter the deposition rate and pattern of inhaled aerosols. However, deposition studies have typically focused on adult subjects, results of which may not be readily extrapolated to children. Furthermore, because of greater ventilation rate per body weight, children receive a greater dose than adults and therefore are more susceptible to respiratory risks. This study is to evaluate the transport and deposition of respiratory aerosols in a nasal-laryngeal airway model based on MRI head images of a 5-year-old boy. Differences between this child and adults in nasal physiology and aerosol filtering efficiency will be emphasized. A validated low Reynolds number (LRN) kâˆ’?‰ turbulence model was employed to simulate laminar, transitional, and fully turbulent flow regimes within the nasal airways. Particle trajectories and deposition in the spectrum of 0.5â€“32 Î¼m were evaluated using a well-tested Lagrangian tracking approach for inhalation flow rates ranging from sedentary (3 L/min) to heavily active (30 L/min) conditions. Simulation results of the inhalation pressure drop and particle deposition rate provided a reasonable match with existing experimental results in nasal airway casts of children. Much higher breathing resistance was observed in the 5-year-old child compared to adults. Furthermore, deposition patterns were sensitive to inhalation flow rate under low activity conditions. An empirical correlation of child nasal filtering efficiency was proposed for micrometer particles based on a wide range of test conditions. Results of this study demonstrate that significant childâ€“adult difference exists in inhaled aerosol depositions, which should be taken into account for risk assessment of airborne toxicants on infants and children.},

  Abstract                 = {A new cell-vortex unstructured finite volume method for structural dynamics is assessed for simulations of structural dynamics in response to fluid motions. A robust implicit dual-time stepping method is employed to obtain time accurate solutions. The resulting system of algebraic equations is matrix-free and allows solid elements to include structure thickness, inertia, and structural stresses for accurate predictions of structural responses and stress distributions. The method is coupled with a fluid dynamics solver for fluid-structure interaction, providing a viable alternative to the finite element method for structural dynamics calculations. A mesh sensitivity test indicates that the finite volume method is at least of second-order accuracy. The method is validated by the problem of vortex-induced vibration of an elastic plate with different initial conditions and material properties. The results are in good agreement with existing numerical data and analytical solutions. The method is then applied to simulate a channel flow with an elastic wall. The effects of wall inertia and structural stresses on the fluid flow are investigated.},

Diffusion in the nanoparticle-polymer composite membrane was enhanced by the presence of a thin "skin" of matrix material next to the surface of the nanoparticles with a penetrant diffusion coefficient 100 times that of the bulk matrix. The influence of the skin thickness, nanoparticle area fraction and the manner in which the nanoparticles were distributed in the membrane on penetrant diffusion was studied. For a given skin thickness the penetrant diffusion in the composite membrane was found to increase exponentially with increasing area fraction of nanoparticles both above and below the percolation threshold. Membranes with clustered nanoparticles were found to have higher penetrants diffusivity than the membranes with fully dispersed particles due to the formation of anisotropic nanoparticle clusters. We found the total area fraction of particlesÂ +Â enhanced matrix (skin) to be a valid scaling variable for the effective diffusion coefficient of the nanoparticle-polymer composite membranes for the entire range of skin thickness and nanoparticle loadings investigated. Implications of the observed dependencies of effective penetrant diffusivity in the composite membrane on nanoparticle loading, skin thickness and nanoparticle morphology are discussed.},

The study was designed to establish normal mucociliary clearance time in healthy children in a tropical environment. Material and methods: The study was carried out in 100 randomly selected normal school children aged 4â€“15 years using saccharin method. The diseases that are known to affect the nasal mucociliary clearance were excluded. The study variables were age and sex. Results: Mean nasal mucociliary clearance time was 5.7Â±2.59 min with no significant difference between males and females. The clearance time was found to be impaired in groups A and B including children of 4â€“7 and 8â€“11 years of age respectively. Conclusion: Nasal mucociliary clearance is impaired in children of either sex between 4 and 11 years probably due to subclinical adenoiditis. However clearance returns to normal level at the time of puberty, which coincides with adenoids involution.},

Deposition efficiency increased with decreasing particle size and flow rate. Compared with inspiratory deposition, expiratory deposition efficiencies were slightly higher for particles below 0.01 {micro}m. Deposition efficiencies under cyclic flow were found to be almost the same as those under constant flow having equivalent mean flow rate. It was also observed that varying the tidal volume, but keeping the minute volume constant (i.e. having the same mean flow rate), has little effect on deposition of ultrafine particles.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of inlet velocity profile on the flow features in obstructed airways is investigated in this study. In reality, the inlet velocity distributions on such models, which are extracted from medial branches of natural human lung, should be neither uniform, nor symmetric parabolic, but skewed-parabolic due to having been skewed by the upper carina ridges. Four different three-dimensional three-generation models based on the 23 generations model of Weibel have been considered, respectively. The fully three-dimensional incompressible laminar Navier-Stokes equations and continuity equation have been solved using CFD solver on unstructured tetrahedral meshes. To reduce the complexity of the simulations, only one Reynolds number of 900 was used in this calculation. Four types of inlet boundary conditions, namely uniform, parabolic, positive-skewed parabolic (skewed to the positive x-direction), and negative-skewed parabolic, were imposed on the obstructed airway models, which were considered to be obstructed at either the second generation or the third generation airways, respectively. The results show that the inlet velocity profile has significant influence on the flow patterns, mass distributions, and pressure drops in either the symmetric model, or the three obstructed models. The three generation airways may not be enough to study the bifurcation flow in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) airways, and a four-generation or more airway model is necessary to get better predictive results.},

The large deformation of the structure alters the flow field significantly while the fluid pressure affects the deformation of the structure strongly. In the bifurcation branches, the relatively short tube collapses into wave number N=3 mode. The strong collapse of the branch tube leads to a large contraction of the cross-sectional area and increases the resistance on the fluid flow. The recirculation occurs at both the up- and down-stream of the collapsed tube.},

  Abstract                 = {Two types of direct-reading aerosol monitoring devices, the TSI, Inc. Model 3320 Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS), and the TSI, Inc. Model 8520 DustTrak Aerosol Monitor (DustTrak), were collocated indoors with a US EPA designated Federal Reference Method (FRM) PM2.5 sampler, the BGI, Inc. PQ200, to assess the comparability of the sampling methods. Simultaneous 24-h samples were collected from two APS instruments, one DustTrak and one FRM sampler for 20 sample periods. The 30-min average concentrations during the 24-hour sample periods were also logged and compared for the APS and DustTrak. Statistical analysis on the mass concentrations obtained from each sampler type included paired t-tests and linear regression. The 24-h average PM2.5 levels from the FRM samplers were approximately normally distributed and ranged from 5.0 to 20.4 Î¼g mâˆ’3 with mean and standard deviation 11.4 and 4.0 Î¼g mâˆ’3, respectively. The 24-h average DustTrak levels are well correlated with FRM levels (R2=0.859) but show significant proportional bias (Î²1=2.57, p&lt;0.0001). The 24-h average mean collocated APS levels are less highly correlated with the FRM (R2=0.592) and do not show statistically significant proportional bias. The 30-min average levels between the two APS instruments show a high correlation (R2=0.979) but significant proportional bias (Î²1=1.31, p&lt;0.0001). The results suggest that though the DustTrak provides precise measurements of PM2.5, the accuracy of the measurements compared to the FRM can be improved through statistical adjustment. In contrast, APS PM2.5 measurements are less precise and less accurate compared to the FRM and therefore results from the APS should be interpreted with caution.},

The CFD simulations show that the proposed method predicts lobar volume changes consistent with direct image-measured metrics, whereas the other two traditional BCs (uniform velocity or uniform pressure) yield lobar volume changes and regional pressure differences inconsistent with observed physiology.},

  Abstract                 = {The motion of micro-particles in channel flow was investigated using the DNS method for Re=3300 (based on center velocity and half channel width). The calculations used the fractional projection method to directly solve the Navier-Stokes equations, and the explicit third-order Runge-Kutta method for the time integration. A higher order finite difference scheme was used to discretize the fluid dynamics equations. The numerical results provided the two-phase flow field in the near-wall region with micro-particles. The simulation results showed that particles with Stokes number on the order of 0.1 tend to congregate near the wall while the micro-particles 1Â [mu]m in diameter distribute homogeneously in the whole flow field. Simulations of micro-particulate matter movement using the [kappa]-[var epsilon] turbulence model applied to the same problem as the DNS analysis showed that the turbulence model could not accurately predict the micro-particle motion in the turbulent flow near the wall, with higher particle concentrations close to the centerline and lower concentrations near the wall.},

  Abstract                 = {We perform large-eddy simulation of turbulent flow separation over an airfoil and evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic jets as a separation control technique. The flow configuration consists of flow over an NACA 0015 airfoil at Reynolds number of 896,000 based on the airfoil chord length and freestream velocity. A small slot across the entire span connected to a cavity inside the airfoil is employed to produce oscillatory synthetic jets. Detailed flow structures inside the synthetic-jet actuator and the synthetic-jet/cross-flow interaction are simulated using an unstructured-grid finite-volume large-eddy simulation solver. Simulation results are compared with the 2005 experimental data of Gilarranz et al., and qualitative and quantitative agreements are obtained for both uncontrolled and controlled cases. As in the experiment, the present large-eddy simulation confirms that synthetic-jet actuation effectively delays the onset of flow separation and causes a significant increase in the lift coefficient. Modification of the blade boundary layer due to oscillatory blowing and suction and its role in separation control is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this work is to specify which model of turbulence is the most adapted in order to predict the drag forces that a swimmer encounters during his movement in the fluid environment. For this, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis has been undertaken with a commercial CFD code (FluentÂ®). The problem was modelled as 3D and in steady hydrodynamic state. The 3D geometry of the swimmer was created by means of a complete laser scanning of the swimmer's body contour. Two turbulence models were tested, namely the standard k-[epsilon] model with a specific treatment of the fluid flow area near the swimmer's body contour, and the standard k-[omega] model. The comparison of numerical results with experimental measurements of drag forces shows that the standard k-[omega] model accurately predicts the drag forces while the standard k-[epsilon] model underestimates their values. The standard k-[omega] model also enabled to capture the vortex structures developing at the swimmer's back and buttocks in underwater swimming; the same vortices had been visualized by flow visualization experiments carried out at the INSEP (National Institute for Sport and Physical Education in Paris) with the French national swimming team.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhinologists are often faced with the challenge of assessing nasal breathing from a functional point of view to derive effective therapeutic interventions. While the complex nasal anatomy can be revealed by visual inspection and medical imaging, only vague information is available regarding the nasal airflow itself: Rhinomanometry delivers rather unspecific integral information on the pressure gradient as well as on total flow and nasal flow resistance. In this article we demonstrate how the understanding of physiological nasal breathing can be improved by simulating and visually analyzing nasal airflow, based on an anatomically correct model of the upper human respiratory tract. In particular we demonstrate how various Information Visualization (InfoVis) techniques, such as a highly scalable implementation of parallel coordinates, time series visualizations, as well as unstructured grid multi-volume rendering, all integrated within a multiple linked views framework, can be utilized to gain a deeper understanding of nasal breathing. Evaluation is accomplished by visual exploration of spatio-temporal airflow characteristics that include not only information on flow features but also on accompanying quantities such as temperature and humidity. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth visual exploration of the physiological function of the nose over several simulated breathing cycles under consideration of a complete model of the nasal airways, realistic boundary conditions, and all physically relevant time-varying quantities.},

  Abstract                 = {Image guided computational fluid dynamics is attracting increasing attention as a tool for refining in vivo flow measurements or predicting the outcome of different surgical scenarios. Sharp interface Cartesian/Immersed-Boundary methods constitute an attractive option for handling complex in vivo geometries but their capability to carry out fine-mesh simulations in the branching, multi-vessel configurations typically encountered in cardiovascular anatomies or pulmonary airways has yet to be demonstrated. A major computational challenge stems from the fact that when such a complex geometry is immersed in a rectangular Cartesian box the excessively large number of grid nodes in the exterior of the flow domain imposes an unnecessary burden on both memory and computational overhead of the Cartesian solver without enhancing the numerical resolution in the region of interest. For many anatomies, this added burden could be large enough to render comprehensive mesh refinement studies impossible. To remedy this situation, we recast the original structured Cartesian formulation of Gilmanov and Sotiropoulos [Gilmanov A, Sotiropoulos F. A hybrid Cartesian/immersed boundary method for simulating flows with 3D, geometrically complex, moving bodies. J Comput Phys 2005;207(2):457-92] into an unstructured Cartesian grid layout. This simple yet powerful approach retains the simplicity and computational efficiency of a Cartesian grid solver, while drastically reducing its memory footprint. The method is applied to carry out systematic mesh refinement studies for several internal flow problems ranging in complexity from flow in a 90Â° pipe bend to flow in an actual, patient-specific anatomy reconstructed from magnetic resonance images. Finally, we tackle the challenging clinical scenario of a single-ventricle patient with severe arterio-venous malformations, seeking to provide a fluid dynamics prospective on a clinical problem and suggestions for procedure improvements. Results from these simulations demonstrate very complex cardiovascular flow dynamics and underscore the need for high-resolution simulations prior to drawing any clinical recommendations.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Increased concentrations of particles in air have been related to changes in inflammatory markers that in turn are hypothesized in mediating the particle effects on cardiovascular disease. The present work examined this association in an elderly cohort in the Greater Boston area and addresses the relative role of particles from different sources. Methods The study included 710 subjects, active members of the VA Normative Aging Study cohort with measurements of blood markers. Concentrations of particle number (PN), black carbon (BC), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and sulphates were measured at a central site near the examination site. Results Positive associations were found between traffic-related particles (PN and BC) and inflammatory markers, but only suggestive associations were found with exposures to PM2.5 and sulphates. The particle effect on the inflammatory markers was greater among subjects older than 78 years and among obese. A suggestion for a greater effect of particles on inflammatory markers among GSTM1-null subjects and non-users of statin drugs was also seen. Conclusions The findings of the study support the hypothesis that particles can induce cardiovascular disease through inflammatory pathways, suggestive of a greater toxicity of traffic-related particles.},

  Abstract                 = {Prediction of particle dispersion and distribution in a room is very important for creating and maintaining a healthy indoor environment. The present study used a CFD program with a Lagrangian particle tracking method to predict particle dispersion and concentration distribution in ventilated rooms. Since the Lagrangian method could generate great uncertainty in particle concentration calculations, this study first investigated such uncertainty using a statistical approach. It was found that the stability of the concentration solution became well controlled as a sufficient number of particles were analyzed. Although the overall computational cost was considerable, the numerical results agreed well with associated experimental data. In all cases studied, particle size distribution was monodisperse, and particle diameter ranged from 0.31 to 4.5 mu m. Particle deposition rate was neglected, and particles were hence removed only by the ventilation system. Thus the particle removal performance of different ventilation systems can be evaluated. Three ventilation systems have been studied, including ceiling and side wall supply systems and an underfloor air distribution (UFAD) system. It was found that the UFAD system had a better particle removal performance than the ceiling and side wall supply systems in the study. However, resuspended particles at the floor level can still cause problems in an UFAD system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Considering spherical nanoparticles in the 1-100Â nm mean-diameter range and different breathing routes with Qtotal=30 and 60Â L/min, local deposition fractions and global surface concentrations were predicted employing an experimentally validated computer simulation model. It was found that the change in breathing route (from nasal to oral breathing) not only significantly influences nanoparticle deposition in the regions of nasal and oral cavities, nasopharynx and oropharynx, but also measurably affects depositions from pharynx to bronchial airways for tiny nanoparticles (<=5Â nm). The effect of breathing routes on deposition of larger nanoparticles (>5Â nm) after the pharynx tends to be minor.

Specifically, different outlet pressures primarily influence the velocity profiles and nanoparticle deposition fractions at that particular branch and adjacent bifurcations. In addition, the impact of change in outlet flow rate ratio on total deposition is confined to all same-level bifurcations and direct upstream-level bifurcations.

  Abstract                 = {Considering a human upper airway model, or equivalently complex internal flow conduits, the transport and deposition of nano-particles in the 1-150 nm diameter range are simulated and analyzed for cyclic and steady flow conditions. Specifically, using a commercial finite-volume software with user-supplied programs as a solver, the Euler-Euler approach for the fluid-particle dynamics is employed with a low-Reynolds-number k-[omega] model for laminar-to-turbulent airflow and the mass transfer equation for dispersion of nano-particles or vapors. Presently, the upper respiratory system consists of two connected segments of a simplified human cast replica, i.e., the oral airways from the mouth to the trachea (Generation G0) and an upper tracheobronchial tree model of G0-G3. Experimentally validated computational fluid-particle dynamics results show the following: (i) transient effects in the oral airways appear most prominently during the decelerating phase of the inspiratory cycle; (ii) selecting matching flow rates, total deposition fractions of nano-size particles for cyclic inspiratory flow are not significantly different from those for steady flow; (iii) turbulent fluctuations which occur after the throat can persist downstream to at least Generation G3 at medium and high inspiratory flow rates (i.e., Qin[greater-or-equal, slanted]30 l/min) due to the enhancement of flow instabilities just upstream of the flow dividers; however, the effects of turbulent fluctuations on nano-particle deposition are quite minor in the human upper airways; (iv) deposition of nano-particles occurs to a relatively greater extent around the carinal ridges when compared to the straight tubular segments in the bronchial airways; (v) deposition distributions of nano-particles vary with airway segment, particle size, and inhalation flow rate, where the local deposition is more uniformly distributed for large-size particles (say, dp=100 nm) than for small-size particles (say, dp=1 nm); (vi) dilute 1 nm particle suspensions behave like certain (fuel) vapors which have the same diffusivities; and (vii) new correlations for particle deposition as a function of a diffusion parameter are most useful for global lung modeling.},

Presently, our respiratory system consists of two major segments of a simplified human cast replica, i.e., a representative oral airway from mouth to trachea (Generation 0) and a symmetric four-generation upper bronchial tree model (G0-G3). The simulation has been validated with experimental data in terms of ultrafine particle deposition efficiencies. The present computational results show the following: (1) At low breathing rates (Qin[approximate]15 l/min), ambient temperature variations ([Delta]Tmax=47 Â°C) influence the local velocity fields and vapor concentrations; however, the total and segmental deposition fractions of fuel vapor in the upper airway are essentially unaffected. (2) The inlet flow rate has a significant effect on vapor deposition, i.e., the higher the flow rate the lower the deposition fraction. (3) The convective heat transfer coefficient averaged over an individual bifurcation unit can be correlated as Nu=0.568(RePr)0.495 (600Â <Â ReÂ <Â 6000). (4) Two new Sherwood number correlations capture the convective mass transfer for the oral airway and individual bifurcations. The methodology outlined and physical insight provided can be also applied to other intake configurations, such as engine ports and inlets to air-breathing propulsion systems.},

  Abstract                 = {In vivo bifurcating airways are complex and the airway segments leading to the bifurcations are not always straight, but curved to various degrees. How do such curved inlet tubes influence the motion as well as local deposition and hence the biological responses of inhaled particulate matter in lung airways? In this paper steady laminar dilute suspension flows of micron-particles are simulated in realistic double bifurcations with curved inlet tubes, i.e., 0Â°[less-than-or-equals, slant][theta][less-than-or-equals, slant]90Â°, using a commercial finite-volume code with user-enhanced programs. The resulting air-flow patterns as well as particle transport and wall depositions were analyzed for different flow inlet conditions, i.e., uniform and parabolic velocity profiles, and geometric configurations. The curved inlet segments have quite pronounced effects on air-flow, particle motion and wall deposition in the downstream bifurcating airways. In contrast to straight double bifurcations, those with bent parent tubes also exhibit irregular variations in particle deposition efficiencies as a function of Stokes number and Reynolds number. There are fewer particles deposited at mildly curved inlet segments, but the particle deposition efficiencies at the downstream sequential bifurcations vary much when compared to those with straight inlets. Under certain flow conditions in sharply curved lung airways, relatively high, localized particle depositions may take place. The findings provide necessary information for toxicologic or therapeutic impact assessments and for global lung dosimetry models of inhaled particulate matter.},

  Abstract                 = {Human sniffing behavior usually involves bouts of short, high flow rate inhalation (>300 ml/s through each nostril) with mostly turbulent airflow. This has often been characterized as a factor enabling higher amounts of odorant to deposit onto olfactory mucosa than for laminar airflow and thereby aid in olfactory detection. Using computational fluid dynamics human nasal cavity models, however, we found essentially no difference in predicted olfactory odorant flux (g/cm2 s) for turbulent versus laminar flow for total nasal flow rates between 300 and 1000 ml/s and for odorants of quite different mucosal solubility. This lack of difference was shown to be due to the much higher resistance to lateral odorant mass transport in the mucosal nasal airway wall than in the air phase. The simulation also revealed that the increase in airflow rate during sniffing can increase odorant uptake flux to the nasal/olfactory mucosa but lower the cumulative total uptake in the olfactory region when the inspired air/odorant volume was held fixed, which is consistent with the observation that sniff duration may be more important than sniff strength for optimizing olfactory detection. In contrast, in rats, sniffing involves high-frequency bouts of both inhalation and exhalation with laminar airflow. In rat nose odorant uptake simulations, it was observed that odorant deposition was highly dependent on solubility and correlated with the locations of different types of receptors.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies that have compared CT or MRI images of an individual's nasal anatomy and measures of their olfactory sensitivity have found a correlation between specific anatomical areas and performance on olfactory assessments. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, we have developed a method to quickly (<few days) convert nasal CT scans from an individual patient into an anatomically accurate 3-D numerical nasal model that can be used to predict airflow and odorant transport, which may ultimately determine olfactory sensitivity. The 3-D model can be also be rapidly modified to depict various anatomical deviations, such as polyps and their removal, that may alter nasal airflow and impair olfactory ability. To evaluate the degree to which variations in critical nasal areas such as the olfactory slit and nasal valve can alter airflow and odorant transport, inspiratory and expiratory airflow with odorants were simulated using numerical finite volume methods. Results suggest that anatomical changes in the olfactory region (upper meatus below the cribriform plate) and the nasal valve region will strongly affect airflow patterns and odorant transport through the olfactory region, with subsequent effects on olfactory function. The ability to model odorant transport through individualized models of the nasal passages holds promise for relating anatomical deviations to generalized or selective disturbances in olfactory perception and may provide important guidance for treatments for nasal-sinus disease, occupational rhinitis and surgical interventions that seek to optimize airflow and improve deficient olfactory function.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The variability of particle deposition in infant and child nasal airways is significant due to the airway geometry and breathing rate. Estimation of particle deposition in the nasal airway of this age group is necessary, especially for inhalation drug delivery application. Previous studies on nasal aerosol deposition were focused mostly on adult. A few empirical equations were also developed to calculate nasal deposition in different age groups of children. However, those studies have their limitations. The aim of this study is to find a simple way to calculate the nasal aerosol deposition in all age groups. Methods: An in vitro test of micrometer particle deposition in nasal airways for three different ages of infants and children is conducted. An adult nasal replica is also studied as a comparison. Monodisperse oleic acid aerosols ranging in size between 2 and 28 mu m are delivered into the replica at the rest condition. This size range covers the deposition efficiency up to around 100%. This study also compares results from our previous deposition tests with a 5-year-old replica. Results: Nasal deposition of micrometer aerosols in small children and infants is higher than that in adults under equivalent breathing conditions, e.g., sitting awake in this study. Combining the data set of infants, children, and adults, we found the deposition in the nasal airway strongly depends on the particle size and pressure drop. The particle deposition can be calculated based on a single empirical equation in all age groups. The intersubject variability within the same age group was not addressed in this study. Conclusions: An empirical equation for all age groups is developed. From this equation, particle deposition efficiency in the nasal airway can best be estimated with input data of particle size and pressure drop of the airway.},

  Abstract                 = {Nasal airflow is one of the most important determinants for nasal physiology. During the long evolution of human beings, different races have developed their own attributes of nasal morphologies which result in variations of nasal airflow patterns and nasal functions. This study evaluated and compared the effects of differences of nasal morphology among three healthy male subjects from Caucasian, Chinese and Indian ethnic groups on nasal airflow patterns using computational fluid dynamics simulation. By examining the anterior nasal airway, the nasal indices and the nostril shapes of the three subjects were found to be similar to nasal cavities of respective ethnic groups. Computed tomography images of these three subjects were obtained to reconstruct 3-dimensional models of nasal cavities. To retain the flow characteristics around the nasal vestibules, a 40Â mm-radius semi sphere was assembled around the human face for the prescription of zero ambient gauge pressure. The results show that more airflow tends to pass through the middle passage of the nasal airway in the Caucasian model, and through the inferior portion in the Indian model. The Indian model was found with extremely low flow flux flowing through the olfactory region. The sizes of vortexes near the anterior cavity were found to be correlated with the angles between the upper nasal valve wall and the anterior head of the nasal cavity.},

  Abstract                 = {Objectives: The impact of race/ethnicity upon facial anthropometric data in the US workforce, on the development of personal protective equipment, has not been investigated to any significant degree. The proliferation of minority populations in the US workforce has increased the need to investigate differences in facial dimensions among these workers. The objective of this study was to determine the face shape and size differences among race and age groups from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health survey of 3997 US civilian workers.Methods: Survey participants were divided into two gender groups, four racial/ethnic groups, and three age groups. Measurements of height, weight, neck circumference, and 18 facial dimensions were collected using traditional anthropometric techniques. A multivariate analysis of the data was performed using Principal Component Analysis. An exploratory analysis to determine the effect of different demographic factors had on anthropometric features was assessed via a linear model. The 21 anthropometric measurements, body mass index, and the first and second principal component scores were dependent variables, while gender, ethnicity, age, occupation, weight, and height served as independent variables.Results: Gender significantly contributes to size for 19 of 24 dependent variables. African-Americans have statistically shorter, wider, and shallower noses than Caucasians. Hispanic workers have 14 facial features that are significantly larger than Caucasians, while their nose protrusion, height, and head length are significantly shorter. The other ethnic group was composed primarily of Asian subjects and has statistically different dimensions from Caucasians for 16 anthropometric values. Nineteen anthropometric values for subjects at least 45 years of age are statistically different from those measured for subjects between 18 and 29 years of age. Workers employed in manufacturing, fire fighting, healthcare, law enforcement, and other occupational groups have facial features that differ significantly than those in construction.Conclusions: Statistically significant differences in facial anthropometric dimensions (P < 0.05) were noted between males and females, all racial/ethnic groups, and the subjects who were at least 45 years old when compared to workers between 18 and 29 years of age. These findings could be important to the design and manufacture of respirators, as well as employers responsible for supplying respiratory protective equipment to their employees.},
